{"rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Well-made, bright, and good deal.","author":"James G. Demian","date":"on April 10, 2018","body":"Wow. Nicely made. Work very well with Li Ion 14500 batteries as well as with AA alkaline (of course dimmer). Not hard to get used to the (stupid) inclusion of Strobe Mode. They automatically cycle from mode to mode each time you turn them off\/on with the tail switch. Hint to make your life easier (such as it is): When (not if) it turns on automatically (every third time) in strobe mode, just gently push down slightly once or twice on the switch to make it cycle between modes to get what you want. Instead of \"jumping up and down, screaming and shouting\", just think ZEN thoughts (Ooooommmm. All is beauty) and gently depress the switch.\n\nAnd think of the amazingness of this: A bright (and cheap and well-made) LED flashlight that operates on one lousy battery at 1 1\/2 volts (yes, even cheap light \"heavy duty\" non-alkalines) or an NiMH rechargeable at 1.35 volts and yet is still not destroyed by 3.7 volt Li Ion's. Would I be as enthusiastic if I'd not got them on sale at 6.99? Well, maybe a little less because the competition in quantity goes for about $3 to $4 per, and if I buy 5 or 6, I'd be giving away a few to friends and that would be even more fun.\n\nOne little nit-picky thing: the \"Two Fluorescent Rings Which Shine in the Dark Night\" (not fluorescent but phosphorescent) the \"rings\" seem to be just those (cheap) little silicone rubber bands sold in handi-craft stores that are woven together (mainly by younger people, it seems) to make rings and bracelets. Yeah, some of those are sold as glow-in-the-dark. My point is that after a few minutes in the dark, I've seen matches brighter than these -yeah UNLIT matches!\n\nOne more thing - if you use 14500 Li Ion batteries: EBL 14500 Li-ion Rechargeable Batteries 3.7V 800mAh for LED Flashlight Torch, 8 Packs most of these are what is called \"unprotected\". In this case, it means if their voltage goes down in the flashlight, they are probably going to be damaged and may never again be able to be charged to full capacity - or at all. So this is my suggestion: if the \"bulb\" starts dimming or shuts off by itself: immediately open the flashlight and take out the battery. That way the flashlight cannot draw down its voltage any more. Since there's no circuit to protect your battery, you have to do it. This should help you protect your investment and continue to give you the nice bright light these batteries give with these flashlights."}

They illuminate so much more than one might expect from a device this size and fit cozily in your pocket, in a desk organizer, etc. You never know when you're going to need to light up under your bed, behind a large appliance or the sidewalk out to your garbage cans early in the morning. The monetary trade off is ridiculous with regards to what you get for your hard earned cash. They rest comfortably in the palm of your hand with intuitive motions to light up. Only thing I can't for the life of me figure out is why there's a strobe setting, but that's just me maybe needing a clue as to a real world application. That said, I am in no way affiliated with this company nor do I foresee any financial compensation for a glowing review.

{"rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Miniature in size & price, but big on light output!","author":"NSB","date":"on February 10, 2018","body":"Given my many prior, poor experiences with several of the low-price\/knockoff CREE type LED, zoomable style flashlights I've bought of this design, these lights are a surprisingly good purchase. I've left off 1 of the 5 stars for 2 main reasons detailed in PRO's\/CON's list below:\nCONS:\n1- Without (very) fresh batteries, the luminosity quoted in the product description isn't consistently provided by these lights- except on full, fresh batteries, the light is much dimmer than it can be when the light has fully powered batteries in it, so you'll end up going through batteries faster than normal (thankfully, the \"Amazon Basics\" AA batteries are very good quality & are very cheap compared to name-brands, so this is a solveable issue, just wasteful, seeing as you end up tossing batteries which still hold some charge- I've ended up using the 1\/2 dead flashlight batteries in my cable box remotes in an effort not to waste them).\n2- Like many of the economical flashlights being sold of this design type, sometimes the power-button press to cycle between modes happens without your input, turning on the strobe setting or the lower light output setting without my intending to do so by pressing the power button.\nPROS:\n1- These lights are very compact, yet with fully charged batteries, they have a high light output for their size. Given the amount of light they provide when fully powered, they do a good job to the point that my wife always keeps one in her purse & her car for being about at night &\/or walking our dog after dark.\n2- Unlike many of the other flashlights I've bought of this design\/type, these lights have held up quality-wise over a decent amount of use- working just as they well as they did when they'd 1st arrived.\n3- The price asked would be inexpensive for 1 CREE-type LED light of this design & high quality, so very good value for a 2 pack!\n\nOverall I certainly recommend them if you're looking for a good, low-cost & compact CREE-type LED, zoomable flashlight which works well & is of good quality.."}

The issue is with the switch logic. There is a single switch that turns it on\/off (hard press) and changes the mode (half press). The problem is that each time you turn it on, it switches to the next mode. So if you are using it in \u201chigh\u201d and turn it off, you will get \u201cstrobe\u201d next time. Not a deal breaker, but annoying.\n\nAgain, great buy to throw in a drawer, but look elsewhere for something to carry every day."}

They are okay for throw away flash lights but they are very undependable and aren't really worth keeping for more than a week. I run a small business that requires me to constantly use a flash light and I bought these as a test run. After about a week they started going in and out. I replaced the batteries and still it only worked about 45% of the time. I'm not a picky person but these had a pretty bad short in their switch so I just kept them in a drawer and used them intermittently. Glad to say though they are finally dead as a door nail and I can replace them with something a lot better."}

And I wish there was a option on the side to toggle modes instead of hitting the power. If you turn it off and on you will have bright light, dimmer light, and the strobe mode and it's somewhat annoying when you're trying to just use a damn flashlight and have to turn it off and on just to get the right light or at least not turn on in strobe mode. Minor stuff and I can't think of a multi-mode LED flashlight that isn't setup like that, but I sure with someone would set them up that way."}

My commute to work is about 20min., which I do by bike after dark 3-4x\/wk. I always used the strobe because it is more conspicuous and drains the battery less than a steady beam, and is legal for a bike headlight in Florida. At first I was very happy with the brightness, but after 2-3wks. the light would require many clicks of the switch to turn on. Then it would go dark during my trip, and afterwards it wouldn't come on at all. This started after a total use of less than 3hrs. in strobe function, and the battery still had plenty of charge. I tried the 2nd light, and had a similar experience. Not wanting to continue risking my life, I tried to return the item, but it was not eligable. I am very dis-satisfied."}

I have been using them for months without an issue. They even work well with rechargeable batteries.\n\nOne caution: Rechargeable batteries + LED's mean that when the power drops below the minimum the LEDs need, you will find that the light just stops working, unlike a bulb which dies slowly, this can cut off entirely. But keep a good charge and you won't be disappointed."}

Which is okay, (for kids) but not great if you need to really see that \"thing\" that is right there... LOOKIN BACK AT YOU ......

Something is rattling around inside, it won't zoom in all the way any more, and there are two rubber band like things that (I'm guessing) used to be inside the flashlight and are very likely related to why it isn't working any more. My work backpack has a pocket on the shoulder strap. It had been in that pocket for maybe a month before I discovered it had broken.\n\nThis flashlight is not rugged. Not even a little. If clipping it on an office worker's backpack for a month breaks something... Well let's just say I'm glad I didn't get into a situation where I was relying on this light. Very glad.\n\nOh, and nothing at all on this product offering about warranty, how to return it, etc. Honestly, I wouldn't accept a replacement. Only a refund.\n\nOne other and less important gripe: The pocket clip is way too rigid and is really hard to get on anything. That's why I put it on the pocket on my backpack shoulder strap. I couldn't even get the clip over the edge of my jeans pocket without using a tool to pry it open.\n\nMove on...get something else. Anything. A glow stick would be better and last longer."}

The total cost for the flashlights, batteries, and charger is about $20 for two. I like the strobe mode for use as an emergency signal. My only \"beef\" with the flashlight industry in general is the black color. Seriously? The point of a flashlight is to improve visibility in the darkness. Try finding a jet black flashlight during a power outage! Flashlights should be neon yellow or orange. I don't care what they look like. I want something I can easily find and use.

'cause, you know, you're so likely to face that \"tactical\" situation.)\nOther quibblette is that it'd be nice to be able to remove the pocket-clip (but it's attached with 2 unusual screws). On the other hand, if it was removed, then the flashlight would roll freely on any surface on which one might lay it - which would NOT be \"desirable\". So, at least the pocket-clip keeps the otherwise completely round flashlight from rolling when layed-down.\nAll in all, I LIKE 'em - a LOT! :-)"}

To be fair to the manufacturer I probably didn't grasp what the dimensions they posted really meant so it's in. I way their fault. For those of you who are not as found of math or lack basic sense of spatial awareness (like me), these little guys are about palm size. Maybe a little smaller or bigger depending on your body proportions, but that's my best comparison out the gate.\n\nAll that being said these are some nifty flashlights. They have a bright, medium, and strobe setting which you change by halfway pressing the power button. I found that out a bit of a startling way, but was none the less impressed.

{"rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Nice small and handy flashlights","author":"M. Brown","date":"on September 1, 2017","body":"One of the flashlights worked great right out of the box. The second light had an issue with the focusing collar. Extending the collar took a greater amount of effort over the first one and it snapped back upon releasing it. If there's an o-ring inside, it's too snug and is creating vacuum on extension. It doesn't snap back all the way leaving about one-eighth inch gap. The only way I could retract it all the way was by rotating the collar as I pressed down and as I pulled up. Eventually I could fully extend it and retract it with no issues. The same flashlight had a short issue with the switch. One day upon pressing the on-off button it flashed on momentarily then remained off. Pushing down on the button had no effect and the switch would not lock in position. It wouldn't even rotate to the next position. I Removed the switch portion from the main body and tapped it on a table and tried pressing again. No change. I eventually screwed the switch back figuring that it was broken. After screwing it back on I tried pushing the button one last time. It worked again! Probably some debris inside the switch worked free. I was going to ask the seller for a new switch as the problem could occur again at some inconvenient future time."}

We're not talking about a zillion lumens, by any stretch. But, click the button, the light goes on. Simple three mode mechanism. Adjustable bezel, push\/pull, to adjust beam size. Flood setting looks best, but not the brighest. Worth the buy, in case of an emergency. Besides, AA batteries are cheaper than dirt, and so easy to find."}

They came in really handy because they got caught in the rain while hiking at night and these worked the entire time (almost one hour) until they got back to their campsite. They are small enough to fit in his jacket pocket so he was the only one to have one with him beside the counselor. We have them in a drawer in our kitchen in case the building loses power and it does all summer so they will come in handy. They are very bright and I would not expect that from such a small flashlight."}
{"rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Four Stars","author":"greg","date":"on May 4, 2017","body":"I wasn't able to open one of them to insert a battery. Very poor design with the battery portal being combined with a light adjustment feature at the top. It just turns and turns as though the battery portal is stripped. What a piece a crap!! It was a waste of time trying to open it and an even bigger waste of money!! In addition, the strobe function should work off an exterior switch that can be activated when the light is on. Not when you turn it off and then turn it back on only to have a useless strobe function activated. That requires you to turn off the light again and turn it back on just to activate its normal function. One agitated customer!"}

A bright, reliable flashlight that can slip into a pocket is a must for us.\n\nShipping was fast with Amazon Prime and the packaging was excellent. These flashlights did not come with batteries, but I had some on hand for the flashlights we already own.\n\nThese flashlights are lightweight and very, very bright. The adjustable beam allows us to search the woods quickly and then to pinpoint what we're searching for. Most recently that was a wild raccoon who was tipping our waste cans and stealing food from the barn cats.\n\nThe clips are strong, enabling us to ensure that the flashlights won't fall out of our pockets while we're working.\n\nI have absolutely no complaints and intend to buy these again!"}

I have a couple of flashlights that stay in the same mode unless you repeatedly press the button, and then stay in that mode until changed again. That's the way all of these should work. It's a real pain to have to click so many times, just to get back to the only setting I'll use: high. Make that change and I'll buy a dozen for everyone in the family."}

The only two downsides are that the clip is tempered and will break if you try to bend it a little more so it's easier to clip on your pocket. The other is that when you turn it off, and then back on it goes to the next mode. So if you turn it off on the bright setting and turn it turn it back on, it'll be on the low setting. The modes are bright, low, & strobe. So I just switch it to strobe before I turn it off, that way it comes on bright. Not a deal breaker for me. But for some it might be."}

One of the push button toggle switches works only when it feels like it - and it's not often it feels like it. The other 3 flashlights work okay, but I wonder how long before their push button toggle switch craps out.\n\nThis is the first time in 14 years of shopping with Amazon that a product we purchased doesn't work. I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.\n\nIt's not worth the hassle to send a $4 flashlight back. It should be thrown away, but then I'm throwing away $4 of my money. It's not the money, it's the principle. Come on Amazon, just suck it up and mail me a working replacement."}

So I find myself looking for smaller but strong and bright flashlights. These led flashlights from rockbirds are the perfect choice for my family. They are small and very sturdy. Strong and very bright. There are what I would call 3 different modes of light. The first is a regular flashlight beam. This light is very bright and shows a long distance from the user. Next is a more.focused beam just pull on the flashlight and you get a smaller more focused beam of light in a square. Next is a flashing mode. I like this one best because I will take the dogs for a walk in the morning before it is light out and I can use this in flashing mode attach it to my jacket so that drivers can see me.\nOverall I have been very impressed with the quality of this flashlight. It is small and light weight. Perfect to keep in your purse, car glove box or anywhere else you might need to."}

The fact that they are small, they can fit anywhere (glove department, purse, pocket- there's even a clip that you can attach to your pocket). Will be a great addition to a survival kit."}
{"rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Five Stars","author":"Chris C","date":"on March 17, 2017","body":"Definitely a fan of these flashlights, they are small but very bright. Really good quality and the clip on them is perfect for outdoor activities when not in use. The perfect size to keep in a convenient place, I put one in my glove compartment and another in my first aid kit. Definitely recommend these as you get an excellent product for the price."}

{"rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Great little flashlights that put out Great light","author":"Amazon Customer","date":"on March 15, 2017","body":"Always, always need flashlights in our house and only LED ones. The flashlight is bright, has a belt clip, fits perfectly in your hand and compact. It has a caution mode, where the light blinks to let others know something is wrong. HOpefully no one will ever have to use that setting. This flashlight being so compact is great for you need to look under cabinets and small spaces. My husband used it for the lower compartment on his boat."}

These are fairly small and light but they are also very sturdy. They do not feel cheap or weak in any way. Really nice quality, well made. I like that they are small, makes them super portable. I also like the adjustable focus feature, could come in handy. I definitely like these and can surely recommend this product."}

I recently started with a volunteer Fire Department and was looking for tools to fill my pockets with. Flashlights are one of those key tools. This little flashlight is simple to use and even with it being so small and with wearing gloves, it is easy to turn on and off. Definitely worth the buy."}
{"rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Five Stars","author":"RavSilver","date":"on March 9, 2017","body":"These are small enough to carry in a purse or backpack. I personally carry one in my purse for those times when I am going to my car late in the evening and need a light to see. I take evening classes and sometimes going to my car is a little scary, so I really like having the flashlight readily available. It eases my stress and fears waking to my car being able to actually see. We recently lost power and I used my rockbird flashlight most of the evening. I was amazed at how long and well it worked. I am very happy with these flashlights and look forward to using them for camping and hiking over the summer. I am impressed for as small as they are, they emit quite a bit of light."}

{"rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Good deal!","author":"MisterP","date":"on March 6, 2017","body":"Super bright little flashlights. The focus on them is fun, but usually not very necessary.

The only complaint I have is I wish the belt clip was heavier"}
{"rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Heavy Duty and Bright","author":"Michael Mills","date":"on March 5, 2017","body":" I snagged it on my bench the other day while I was working and bent it all up. I took off the clip (held on by two small allen screws) and applied some love with a pair of pliers and it works great again. I don't know if anyone else would have this problem and it's easy to fix, so it's not worth taking off a star. I may make a heavier clip for it myself though.\n\nOverall, they do what I expect them to do."}
{"rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Awesome","author":"Kristi Fahlsing","date":"on March 5, 2017","body":"This set of two flashlights are a great deal in my opinion. I gave my husband one to use in his tow truck and one stays in the house for me. These flashlights are very bright and you can adjust the scope of the light from a large area to a precise close area. I use my flashlight in the house to check on eggs in an incubator so I pull the top of the flashlight out to narrow the scope. It is plenty bright for me to see the babies in the eggs. My husband has used his for lots of things in the tow truck. It is great for lots of jobs since it has adjustable lighting. It's also easy for him to keep on himself with the metal clip and non-slip grip. I like that they are made with aluminium so they are lightweight and durable. So far they show no wear and tear even though we are constantly using them."}

So far I haven't had any problems with the flashlights which seem to be pretty durable and are just what I expected."}

This flashlight is perfect because it is small enough to fit just about anywhere that you want to put a flashlight. You could carry this in your purse, your vehicle, it even has a clip for a belt. Just remember, batteries are not included. So you will need two AA batteries. I am pleased with this purchase. :-)"}

{"rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Brighter Than Expected","author":"James King","date":"on February 15, 2017","body":" These Rockbirds LED Flashlights I bought came it a pack of 2 for only $9.99 which is a crazy good deal. I collect LED flashlights and have about 30 right now but I really like these smaller ones because I can just keep them in my pocket.\nThese are heavy duty and made with aluminum. The battery compartment has an O ring to keep moisture out. They are waterproof but not to be submerged in water but they will withstand rain.\nThe beam is adjustable and you can see that in the video I provided to go with this review and I also show all 3 modes of lighting. All you need to do is slightly tap the on and off switch and it will change modes.\nPlease watch the video to get a better idea of what I am talking about. Overall it is excellent for the price and you get 2! I give this 5 stars easily. I hoped this helped in some way."}

They feel very solid though, and the illumination is great for the size. They easily clip inside the pocket of a pair of jeans and feel very similar to a clipped folding knife in my pocket. The housing at the end of the light slides in and out to adjust the beam, and there is a strobe setting on the light when you press the power button off and on again. Two lights come in the package. At first it seemed a little spendy for them when looking at their size, but as I have used it, and had it in my pocket, these are 20 times the light you get at a dollar store, or by spending less somewhere else. I bought 3 packs of 2. They have held up under the abuse my son's and friends dish out so far. And, they are very compact."}
