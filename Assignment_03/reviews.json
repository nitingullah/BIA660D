little flashlight, they work good on 1.2 volt rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries.","1":"It's exactly as described and I received it quickly.","2":"Very small and very bright. These fit easy into any pocket yet they are bright. They make a good every day carry light. Pair it with amazon rechargeable battery and you are ready to go. The clip is sturdy and easy to clip onto the pocket.","3":"Good flashlights at a good price.","4":"Received 2 flashlights. One worked fine, the other would not turn on","5":"These lights are alot nicer than I expected for the price","6":"Well made, solid aluminum. Was tough to figure out how to unscrew it to put batteries in. Its the little cap on the end where the push button on switch is.","7":"Not what i got as advertised. When you zoom in it doesnt even look like the LED shape, it is blurry and week. Quality wasn't the greatest when i took the flashlight apart. Electronics were not well put together and weren't held in place.","8":"Junk junk junk sums it up","9":"Really good for the price.","10":"They both work great. Can adjust beam very easily. Fast shipping","11":"The 1st flashlight I used at work fell apart in my pocket.The barrel that focuses the light stripped out the inner threads.I will try the 2nd light this week.","12":"I ordered these to put in our camper for a light that didn't require a lot of room. These are perfect and give off light exactly what as I wanted. I would buy them again.","13":"This flashlight is exactly what I wanted.","14":"Really great flashlights. Well made, bright light! A great buy!","15":"Good little well made flashlight. Can't beat them for the price. They make nice gifts.","16":"Because they were $4 each that got them one star. Because they worked they got another. Because they did not work properly two stars is all they are worth.","17":"We were looking for a decent flashlight for outdoor use - primary in the back yard to spot the pets or other critters. I took a shot at these since they were on sale. They arrived and we kinda laughed thinking they wouldn't do the job.\n\nWe were wrong. Our back yard goes back 80 feet or so. This thing lights it up in spot mode or the more open mode. It's great. I'll be picking up a couple more.","18":"Very nice, works great","19":"These are sturdy little flashlights that we plan to use in our kayaks in case we need a light. They are a lot sturdier than I would have thought for the price, and they have the flashing lights that would be of use if we find ourselves stranded out at night.","20":"EXCELLENT FLASHLIGHT ! Not sure exactly what people ,who wrote a 2 paragraph review, were expecting from a $5 flashlight !?","21":"This is the 2nd set of RockBirds I have purchased! Love this product! Sturdy, powerful beam, lightweight an compact!","22":"It is small but mighty. This little flashlight is very bright. It also is light so I can carry in my pocket, purse, or on my belt loop.","23":"Just the right size for pocket, good light ,variable beam great to work with, bottom line for the price you can't lose","24":"I purchased some larger flashlights recently but needed something that was easier to carry daily. I love the size and the build quality. Plus just one AA battery is nice. They are nice and bright and have a cool zoom feature.","25":"What a great price you just can't beat it.","26":"These are very cheaply made. Once of these broke after 2 uses.","27":"Sturdy little lights that work every time as advertised","28":"Wow. Nicely made. Work very well with Li Ion 14500 batteries as well as with AA alkaline (of course dimmer). Not hard to get used to the (stupid) inclusion of Strobe Mode. They automatically cycle from mode to mode each time you turn them off\/on with the tail switch. Hint to make your life easier (such as it is): When (not if) it turns on automatically (every third time) in strobe mode, just gently push down slightly once or twice on the switch to make it cycle between modes to get what you want. Instead of \"jumping up and down, screaming and shouting\", just think ZEN thoughts (Ooooommmm. All is beauty) and gently depress the switch.\n\nAnd think of the amazingness of this: A bright (and cheap and well-made) LED flashlight that operates on one lousy battery at 1 1\/2 volts (yes, even cheap light \"heavy duty\" non-alkalines) or an NiMH rechargeable at 1.35 volts and yet is still not destroyed by 3.7 volt Li Ion's. Would I be as enthusiastic if I'd not got them on sale at 6.99? Well, maybe a little less because the competition in quantity goes for about $3 to $4 per, and if I buy 5 or 6, I'd be giving away a few to friends and that would be even more fun.\n\nOne little nit-picky thing: the \"Two Fluorescent Rings Which Shine in the Dark Night\" (not fluorescent but phosphorescent) the \"rings\" seem to be just those (cheap) little silicone rubber bands sold in handi-craft stores that are woven together (mainly by younger people, it seems) to make rings and bracelets. Yeah, some of those are sold as glow-in-the-dark. My point is that after a few minutes in the dark, I've seen matches brighter than these -yeah UNLIT matches!\n\nOne more thing - if you use 14500 Li Ion batteries: EBL 14500 Li-ion Rechargeable Batteries 3.7V 800mAh for LED Flashlight Torch, 8 Packs most of these are what is called \"unprotected\". In this case, it means if their voltage goes down in the flashlight, they are probably going to be damaged and may never again be able to be charged to full capacity - or at all. So this is my suggestion: if the \"bulb\" starts dimming or shuts off by itself: immediately open the flashlight and take out the battery. That way the flashlight cannot draw down its voltage any more. Since there's no circuit to protect your battery, you have to do it. This should help you protect your investment and continue to give you the nice bright light these batteries give with these flashlights.","29":"Nice flashlight, Good value","30":"Bright little flashlights that feel very substantial for such a low cost.","31":"Small and powerful","32":"Wow, I just popped an AA battery in, and this thing is bright.","33":"Love these flashlights! It does everything it said it would do!","34":"This product came quickly and in perfect condition. Easy to use, accurate, durable, and very useful in our camping night. Great buy.","35":"Solid product. Works as well as flashlights 3 or 4 times the cost of this one, at least. I will buy another pair, soon.","36":"Great product for the price! Arrived as stated. Good packaging. Would recommend","37":"Small compact light that you carry every day. So far great light. Only time will tell how durable and dependable it is.","38":"Ridiculously small. You are mislead by the picture on the site.","39":"Only one works. The one that does is mediocre at best.","40":"Most: size, uses 2A battery, adjustable light beam. Least: the method used to change the light mode.","41":"Awesome little light, highly recommend","42":"Durable, lightweight and very bright","43":"Very good quality lights for the size of flashlight","44":"They work great. Flashlights are small but do a great job of lighting up the area.","45":"Great little bright light!","46":"Great product..","47":"These are compact size flashlights, fit in palm. 3 light levels with click of button at the end of flash light. It is good for daily use to keep in the pocket for emergencies or just for walking the dog at night. Recommended","48":"Very small which was awesome and it was doing what I bought it for until the light stopped turning on. Flashlights seem to have a mind of there own. These would work good for around the house and emergency use but not for any type of work\/long periods of off and on usage.","49":"Arrived very quickly and seem to be a good product. I admit they were smaller than I expected, but that worked out okay because they're a good size to carry in a pocket.","50":"Lite lighting lasting longer liberally.","51":"Arrived fast and in perfect condition. Using 2 in motorhome for camping and 2 for home. Tried one out at it has a very bright light for its size. Am going to love carrying a smaller, lighter flashlight around. Has a clip to hang on belt or purse. Thanks for a great product.","52":"The button doesn't seem to have an actuation point so you seem to have to press rather firmly to change light settings but some times it actuates with little pressure. Edges on the frame feel uncomfortable.","53":"These flashlights are small but very powerful! I love them and are easy to have anywhere. I recommend this product.","54":"FYI, to get it to switch modes, you turn it of then on again and it switches. It goes from (1) bright --> (2) Dimmer --> (3) Flashing.\n\nThe flashing is obnoxious. I wish I could get rid of that. I see no need for that in my life or 99% of anyone who buys this thing. It just threatens you with a seizure as you try to quickly switch it off and on to a different mode.\n\nBut the light is fairly bright. No big complaints with how it works when it's just on and working.","55":"I absolutely LOVE these mini flashlights. They illuminate so much more than one might expect from a device this size and fit cozily in your pocket, in a desk organizer, etc. You never know when you're going to need to light up under your bed, behind a large appliance or the sidewalk out to your garbage cans early in the morning. The monetary trade off is ridiculous with regards to what you get for your hard earned cash. They rest comfortably in the palm of your hand with intuitive motions to light up. Only thing I can't for the life of me figure out is why there's a strobe setting, but that's just me maybe needing a clue as to a real world application. That said, I am in no way affiliated with this company nor do I foresee any financial compensation for a glowing review. I would have been stoked receiving just one of these flashlights but getting two? i say see for yourself, you won't be disappointed!!","56":"Excellent led , portable","57":"They are quite bright and seem to be solidly constructed, but the picture made them seem a bit larger than they really are. They can only hold one AA battery, so if you're expecting the larger kind with the caddy that holds three AAA batteries, you will be a bit disappointed. That said, even as small as they are, the price is very good.","58":"When I click the button it shines brightly","59":"i have to buy batteries china junk","60":"Arrived on time and product is as depicted. Great mini flashlights for the price. Bought these for my husband who uses them at work. Would definitely buy again","61":"This is a small iron flashlight, it is very convenient to carry, the quality is also very good, the light is very bright, the lamp head part can also adjust the length of the light, and it is two equipment, cheap and affordable, I like it!","62":"Awesome flashlight for the price!","63":"Got these two flashlights on sale and well worth the price. Like the small compact size with a lot of light emanating from the bulbs. Great feature of bright, less bright, and a flasher. One is next to the bed, the other in the car for those emergencies. Also, like the ability to focus the beam when necessary. This is the kind of thing that you don't need until you get it. Highly recommend.","64":"Decent enough light. But I hated the fact that I had to cyclce through the modes every time i turned it on.","65":"It\u2019s tiny cute flashlight. As of luminous flux , this little flashlight generates amazing light intensity that can be light up a spot 50 yards, even 100 yards away. There are two light modes, the continuous one and the twinkling one.","66":"Better than I was expecting for the price and super bright for how tiny they are. If you put a good AA battery in them you will be stoked. I like that the light can focus in on small spaces. Good for exploring tight spaces. I would imagine they would be good in the mechanic industry. I mostly bought them for walking at night so people dont run me over. And for going into tunnels and sewage drains to look for clowns and stuff.","67":"This is one of the must haves for each and every family. We used it for night time outdoor exploration, under closet repair and kids love it for haunted house.","68":"One of the flashlights switch does not work.","69":"They are working good. I love it!","70":"DOA and this item is not eligible for return!","71":"They aren't bad lights, Really bright, lightly depress the switch and release to change the operating mode, I Just happened to get one with a bad switch, It pops loudly, occasionally doesn't work or won't turn off. The other flashlight is fine. Oh, the fluorescent lines? Those are silicone\/rubber bands that glow in the dark.","72":"Can\u2019t even get a battery in it. And it\u2019s not bright at all once I finally got the top open. It just kept spinning and spinning. Now I can\u2019t get the batteries out","73":"1 of the 2 flashlights work. but not as advertised. Did not find the \"nonreturnable\" part until after receiving the items. Rechecked the original page for the order and nowhere does it say \"nonreturnable\". Waste of my money!","74":"It's compact, lightweight, focusable, and bright - exactly what I was looking for.","75":"Really bright for the size one aa battery a plus","76":"They're very small, but work well for a 4 inch flashlight","77":"It's okay.","78":"Muy bueno.","79":"Of the two, one worked perfectly, the other would only switch on in dim mode, and needed to be switched to bright mode. They are build solidly and the working one does a good job. Amazon customer service is perfect as always and resolved the issue to my satisfaction. I would try them again, my guess is I just got a bad one.","80":"One of the two lights I received does not work. I didnt know it was not returnable before receiving it.","81":"Ok for a kid","82":"Good little flash light.","83":"So the one I could open to put a battery works ok, but the other one doesn't unscrew so its useless. Not a great deal.\nupdate (5 minutes later) After taking the battery out and trying to reassemble the one that worked, the housing which holds the lens over the LED came off, so 100% garbage. stay away.","84":"Very small and very good quality, there are three kinds of adjustment brightness","85":"Very great LED flashlights for last minute emergencies I definitely recommend this.","86":"Overall it is well built for the price however the max output is probably not even 150 lumens. To call this 300 lumens is such false advertisement. It is bright enough to do the job and AA batteries are easy to find and they are cheap enough to loose or keep around.","87":"awesome little lights","88":"Retry??? Great product offers need great reviews POSTED, eh?","89":"One of the two works fine, the other one does not work at all. It doesn't click, it seems all empty inside the orange ball, where it is supposed to click on and off. Cheap stuff, not worth to send back.","90":"Very practical flashlight. Comes in handy for this nurse!","91":"small in size, good quality, bright enough. The reason I purchased this is because the hook that coming with it. Before this, I lost many of the flashlight. Love the hooks, no need to worry that I gonna lost it again.","92":"The zoom does not work on any of the flashlights I received. I do not recommend this flashlight.","93":"These were great and worth every penny.","94":"This is a great mini flashlights! The size is small and fits so comfortable in my hand or put in my pocket. Also they are so bright than i expect. Very reasonable price for two, five stars!","95":"Little cute flesh lights! Love it. Small , handy and great quality.","96":"This is a small compact flashlight with a bright light, I have found it to be handy for lots of little things and big ones like flipping the fuse box. The only downside is I hate the strobe light because it hurts my eyes and you have to see the strobe in order to turn the flashlight off. The other downside is the flashlight has a lot of blue.","97":"The flashlights are great for the price. It fits the pocket and easy to carry around. It runs on one AA battery and bright enough for most of the tasks.","98":"Love it. So useful when I trying to fix my pipe. Strong light with amazing size. All I can say is fantastic","99":"These came in handy during Hurricane Irma. We live in Orlando, we lost power around midnight. These got us through that night. We eventually had to leave our home, No power for 7 days.But these little suckers were Very illuminating, Good on batteries, small but mighty. I bought one for each of my kids. It kept them entertained as the storm passed over us. We were able to play board games & cards games all night with these as our light.","100":"This flashlight is super bright. I can have my bathroom light off, which is in the middle of the house so very dark, and this light will light the whole room up. you can see just like the light was on. This light is amazing!","101":"Small and exquisite, easy to carry around.","102":"Ultra-convenient and compact flashlight and a group of two, super easy to carry, do not have to fear the dark place","103":"A perfect flashlight,it\u2019s easy to carry .The light is very bright and I don't have to worry about keeping spare batteries around for it. I bought this for my daughter dand she loves it.","104":"you get what pay for","105":"I own several smaller Cree LED flashlights and I'm very impressed by the performance for the size. This is a step up from the smaller lights and puts out some serious light. Brightest flashlight I've ever owned. Zoom feature is great!","106":"These small LED flashlights are wonderful! Small enough to carry inconspicuously, yet still extremely bright when needed!!","107":"Nice bright lights. You get what you paid for, nothing special. I would recommend them.","108":"These are great for work. Get the upgraded batteries","109":"These flashlights are so valuable and they are very easy to carry, also they are very bright, i think i spent 10 dollars very worthy that hard to find another place!","110":"1 works fine . the other blinks intermittently","111":"Works great.","112":"Great product","113":"GREAt, compact flashlight. Nice quality","114":"Excellent deal for a pair of probably most efficient flashlights ever invented.","115":"Already no longer working after minimal use.","116":"Great little flashlights.","117":"I bought 2 and they worked great for 2-3 weeks then they quit working. Was using in a hot, humid climate. ( New batteries didn't help)","118":"Very bright flashlight. Used at the beach walking at night looking fir shells. Decent battery life","119":"works good, I used this during hurricane irma","120":"Better quality than I was expecting...didn't use yet","121":"nice","122":"These give amazing light and are very sturdy. A bit heavy for a compact light, but the clip makes it easy to carry. I ordered them for our hurricane supply kit after Irma hit us. We've used them several times and were so pleased that I got them for my brother too.","123":"Price is too good to be true. Don\u2019t expect them to last. One of mine just died and the other only flashes?!?! It\u2019s been 2 months so I can\u2019t return. Not happy! Good luck!","124":"great , small but powerful .","125":"They are great for reading a menu in a dark restaurant","126":"Small and powerful!","127":"Buy many, keep them everywhere. AA battery is a major advantage, some have.shelf-lives of decades, means always ready in boat, car or outhouse.","128":"GReat Product!","129":"I liked these so well that I gave them out as stocking stuffers to out family. They're built well, look nice, are plenty bright and small enough to have on hand or carry wherever you go. If you need a great little, durable flashlight, you can't go wrong with these. Highly recommended for sportsman and women of all activities, kids and folks in general looking for a small, bright, portable flashlight.","130":"Given my many prior, poor experiences with several of the low-price\/knockoff CREE type LED, zoomable style flashlights I've bought of this design, these lights are a surprisingly good purchase. I've left off 1 of the 5 stars for 2 main reasons detailed in PRO's\/CON's list below:\nCONS:\n1- Without (very) fresh batteries, the luminosity quoted in the product description isn't consistently provided by these lights- except on full, fresh batteries, the light is much dimmer than it can be when the light has fully powered batteries in it, so you'll end up going through batteries faster than normal (thankfully, the \"Amazon Basics\" AA batteries are very good quality & are very cheap compared to name-brands, so this is a solveable issue, just wasteful, seeing as you end up tossing batteries which still hold some charge- I've ended up using the 1\/2 dead flashlight batteries in my cable box remotes in an effort not to waste them).\n2- Like many of the economical flashlights being sold of this design type, sometimes the power-button press to cycle between modes happens without your input, turning on the strobe setting or the lower light output setting without my intending to do so by pressing the power button.\nPROS:\n1- These lights are very compact, yet with fully charged batteries, they have a high light output for their size. Given the amount of light they provide when fully powered, they do a good job to the point that my wife always keeps one in her purse & her car for being about at night &\/or walking our dog after dark.\n2- Unlike many of the other flashlights I've bought of this design\/type, these lights have held up quality-wise over a decent amount of use- working just as they well as they did when they'd 1st arrived.\n3- The price asked would be inexpensive for 1 CREE-type LED light of this design & high quality, so very good value for a 2 pack!\n\nOverall I certainly recommend them if you're looking for a good, low-cost & compact CREE-type LED, zoomable flashlight which works well & is of good quality..","131":"Tiny yet powerful and the battery charge seems to last a long time.","132":"My husband is obsessed with this flashlight. One battery and it lights up like a police helicopter. Best flashlight ever. It can zoom or be diffuse. It's heavy and wish it had a wrist strap but otherwise awesome.","133":"Works great. Husband and Dad liked the flash lights and size is easy to take with you anywhere. Will buy again","134":"Awesome value for the price!! Well build and powerful enough - the lenses are a smart way of defusing the light - it works well.","135":"Considering how little it costs for two of them, they are well built and very bright. The issue is with the switch logic. There is a single switch that turns it on\/off (hard press) and changes the mode (half press). The problem is that each time you turn it on, it switches to the next mode. So if you are using it in \u201chigh\u201d and turn it off, you will get \u201cstrobe\u201d next time. Not a deal breaker, but annoying.\n\nAgain, great buy to throw in a drawer, but look elsewhere for something to carry every day.","136":"I loved these Rockbird flashlights. I already have these flashlights for over a year, and they still work wonderfully. I lived in Florida and they came in handy when we got hit with hurricane Irma.","137":"Got it for my granddaughter camping trip. Small size which was great and very bright light.","138":"These are my favorite! Very bright, compact, and zoomable. Plus they come in 2 pack. One for the car, and one for home. These are awesome for their price.","139":"terrible\uff01\uff01\uff01","140":"they stop working!!!!","141":"The best thing on this phone is that it is sturdy and operates on one AA battery. I don't dislike anything about this phone.","142":"BRIGHT! (and small)","143":"Not as bright as i thought it would be","144":"These lights seem to have issues after a little use but as to be expected from a low priced light. It\u2019s good as a light for the kids or in a tool box but don\u2019t plan on performance.","145":"GREAT LITTLE FLASH LITE","146":"After a long time of carrying these disappointments I am glad to say I can buy a new flash light. They are okay for throw away flash lights but they are very undependable and aren't really worth keeping for more than a week. I run a small business that requires me to constantly use a flash light and I bought these as a test run. After about a week they started going in and out. I replaced the batteries and still it only worked about 45% of the time. I'm not a picky person but these had a pretty bad short in their switch so I just kept them in a drawer and used them intermittently. Glad to say though they are finally dead as a door nail and I can replace them with something a lot better.","147":"U get what u pay for","148":"GREAT little flashlights! Powerful, tough, inexpensive. Strongly recommend!","149":"BOTH flash lights stopped operating in less than a week! I have had excellent service life from other LED merchants. No excuse\nfor such dismal performance. Steven Belaus","150":"one was broken (button turns on, selects through modes, won't turn off) but the other is just fine.","151":"Good buy for the price but are not as bright as other flashlights on this site","152":"Super cheap. These are kind of our tiny emergency flashlights so I wasn't expecting a big sturdy flashlight. These are barely bigger than chapstick and are not that easy to put batteries in. They work but I wouldn't buy again.","153":"Great for hikes. Light. Easy to use","154":"Great product","155":"Pretty good, well made. not real sure about 300L","156":"Works great and even survived a hand washing submerged in water.\nMy personal gripes would be when you focus the light it looks like a logo instead of a generic beam and between the different flashlights the \"logo\" isn't even placed at the same consistent angle. And I wish there was a option on the side to toggle modes instead of hitting the power. If you turn it off and on you will have bright light, dimmer light, and the strobe mode and it's somewhat annoying when you're trying to just use a damn flashlight and have to turn it off and on just to get the right light or at least not turn on in strobe mode. Minor stuff and I can't think of a multi-mode LED flashlight that isn't setup like that, but I sure with someone would set them up that way.","157":"Works as advertised. No issues.","158":"These RockBirds 7W LED Mini Tactical flashlights are not that bright (but many LEDs flashlights are really too bright for most uses). They use a lens to give a highly focused beam, which isn't very good for just walking around. I like that they don't need special batteries, just AAs","159":"No instructions as to how to open and replace batterys, they did not light when button was pressed.","160":"Junk. One had the on off button quit working after a few uses and the other won\u2019t turn on half the time. Oh yeah and sometimes it just blinks and blinks and won\u2019t shut off. Have to take battery out to shut it off.","161":"very cheap. Light does not go very far in dark. You get what you pay for. Fast shipment.","162":"Great bang for the buck. It provides a lot of light for a product so small.","163":"Dropped it one time from about 3ft on to dirt and the piece that focuses the light broke. Will not buy these ever again","164":"pleased with purchase, just as described","165":"These flashlights are AWESOME!!! They are very compact and do the job they need to do. They are great for around the house. Keep one in the car in case you break down. They have that neat flashing feature to warn other motorists. Take one with you while you are out walking or while you are out with your pets. The little pocket clip is a bonus. I think for the money and the size, this is the best flashlight I've ever bought.","166":"I love them!! OMG they look so cool and are so bright!!! I was checking the tires a few days ago and suddenly the whole \"neighborhood\" went visible! lol..\nAwesome design and I love how durable they are!\nI'll definitely recommend to my everyone I know..","167":"The low price is the only reason I am giving this flashlight a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star rating. This is not bright at all even on the \"high\" setting. The metal finish on the ones I received is spotty and not finished. Not impressed at all.","168":"They look nice but bad quality, they rarely come on when u push the button. Have to twist the battery cover part to get it to work","169":"drains my battery quick even when of, COULD BE my personal rechargeable battery that isn't working as it should. overall they both work great and as described.","170":"Nice product for a good price. Wish it had a setting to remember the last light mode used instead of having to cycle through all the settings each time you turn the light off.","171":"I bought these to use as a bike headlight. My commute to work is about 20min., which I do by bike after dark 3-4x\/wk. I always used the strobe because it is more conspicuous and drains the battery less than a steady beam, and is legal for a bike headlight in Florida. At first I was very happy with the brightness, but after 2-3wks. the light would require many clicks of the switch to turn on. Then it would go dark during my trip, and afterwards it wouldn't come on at all. This started after a total use of less than 3hrs. in strobe function, and the battery still had plenty of charge. I tried the 2nd light, and had a similar experience. Not wanting to continue risking my life, I tried to return the item, but it was not eligable. I am very dis-satisfied.","172":"Works well. Thank you.","173":"These are good to have everywhere, especially like the clips on side so handy. Great when walking dog after dark, in car, bedside, to hold somewhere while hands busy repairing anything. Not tremendously bright but worth owning. Great stocking stuffers. Affordable.","174":"These flashlights are amazing I have one in my car for emergencies and I have another one to use when I walk my dog. The lighting is great for long distance As well as short.","175":"Didn\u2019t work even tried several batteries","176":"I was VERY disappointed with these flashlights. The very first time I pushed the button to turn on the button collapsed in. Apparently they can\u2019t be returned which is awesome.","177":"Didn't realize how much I'd be using these little flashlight but I use them nightly.","178":"I had to get a flashlight that fitted my 1\u201d light mount for an upcoming airsoft skirmish. Thought I might as well get a combo pack! These little things pack quite a punch, and they\u2019re tough. There not fully water resistant but they lasted through some rainfall and condensation. The lens is also quite thick because I also drop them on a concrete floor and not even a slight scratch. I ended up using them periodically over a time span of 7 hours in below 26\u00b0 F weather and haven\u2019t notice them go dim. Would recommend them because of the great value!","179":"Small and convenient. Can never have enough flashlights in case of emergency.","180":"Great value for the money would recommend to all. I am an appliance repairman use one every day","181":"Excellent product at an excellent price! Arrived on time and was as described.","182":"If i could give this product a zero i would. Absolutely terrible trash. Have yet to work properly. Wish i could have returned them. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.","183":"Very bright nice flashlight.","184":"What a waste of money! These things looked like they'd be great, and I liked the adjustability of the beam angle. But they both stopped working within 1 week of being used. I've had lower quality cheaper crap from the dollar store last longer than these! I only rated them 1 star because there isnt an option for ZERO stars or even negative stars!","185":"Great for the car. Inexpensive. Cheap on batteries. Small and can be put anywhere. A lot of light for a single AA battery.","186":"one broke the other was lost","187":"Light is bright, material is good and it worked as advertised","188":"Great deal. Size and weight have made them a go to light for camping, hiking, or working around the yard\/home.","189":"These are decent lights to keep around the house or in the car. They aren\u2019t super high quality, one of mine the rubber cover over the on\/off switch was installed wrong and it makes it hard to operate the light. I don\u2019t think they are really 300 lumens either. I have a 300 lumen light that I compared it to and these are a lot dimmer. Good cheap flashlight.","190":"very nice set comes in handy, one for the wife an one for me. I like the clip so that I cant loose it. small compact bright, great unit","191":"Awesome lights!","192":"Great!","193":"Small, incredibly bright, and I love that it comes in a pair.","194":"These things seriously have range...great flashlight and size makes them convenient. Wicked bargain would buy again!","195":"I really liked these.. Until they just broke about a month after use. Changing battery and then never worked again. Same for both flashlights in pack","196":"Light is weak, the strobe-light is pointless, and maybe just barely worth $5. Expected more quality, but it's all looks.","197":"they are a great deal. they are not high end, but for the price, they throw a lot of light with 1 battery. Put them in all of the cars.","198":"Great light, very bright for the price. Don't really care for the strobe mode, and you have to cycle through it to get back to the brightest mode. But what can you expect for such a cheap price.","199":"great","200":"One did not work. Switched the tail caps and they both work for now.. . It gives a good amount of light, but 3 stars because now I can\u2019t rely on the light.","201":"i gave it 3 stars because only one of the flash lights worked. it didnt seem worth it to send them back since i really only needed one for a Christmas gift, just seemed easier and cheaper to get the two pack. I put the batteries in and one worked right away while the other only pretends to work if the spring touches the side wall while the battery is in it and that's impossible to use since you have to close the cap to keep the battery inside. The one that works however is awesome and more than what i expected it to be, flashes, zooms and expands and is very bright for its small size. just wish the other one worked. overall happy with the one that works but disappointed only one worked","202":"I ordered similar lights to this in the past... LOVED THEM! These however constantly cycle the features each time you turn the light on.\n\nFor example:\nFirst time you turn it on... Super bright.\nNext time... Dim mode.\nNext time... Flashing pattern.\n\nNORMALLY... These types of flashlights should function:\nMomentary press button = Changes mode.\nTurn unit off = Remembers where it was.","203":"Really good low cost flash lights. I got them last minute for a camping trip and they worked amazing.","204":"Its a lot brighter with duracell batteries. I belive there are better batteries for it but idk.","205":"These are very lightweight and last forever on a single AA battery.\n\nI use them for evening strolls around (an increasingly dark as winter is upon us) set of streets and the flash mode make me very obvious to oncoming cars.\n\nSuper lightweight, and built to last. I have been using them for months without an issue. They even work well with rechargeable batteries.\n\nOne caution: Rechargeable batteries + LED's mean that when the power drops below the minimum the LEDs need, you will find that the light just stops working, unlike a bulb which dies slowly, this can cut off entirely. But keep a good charge and you won't be disappointed.","206":"Thank you","207":"THEY PUT THE OLD FLASH LITES TO SHAME. I HAVE BOUGHT MANY","208":"goes perfectly with my bug out bag","209":"Lights work well and are bright. You have to cycle by pressing buttons for the three different settings. Not bad for the price.","210":"great value for the money and brighter beam than expected. Nice telescoping feature that allows you to adjust the light beam width\/brightness","211":"These little things pack a punch! They let out tons of light despite the small size.","212":"Bought these to keep on us during hurricane Irma. They worked well and I loved the clip. Made it a bit harder to lose track of.","213":"these little flash lights pack a punch!","214":"These lights are EXCELLENT for the price!","215":"Nice bright compact light for the price. The focused beam is an odd square shape, but not an issue for me. Have been using for about 3 months and seem to be good quality. Will buy more.","216":"Great little light. Well worth the money. Built well for a small light.","217":"The switch button on the end operates easily, but not so easily as to come on when, say, searching for my keys and being dead the next day.\nI like the single AA battery.\nI like the compact size. It's bright for its size-and this goes to the one thing I disliked: one photo shows this lite brightly illuminating both sides of a sidewalk. This doesn't quite do that. That overstatement is what gets this 4 stars instead of 5 from me. I got over that quickly. Ounce for ounce, this unit pulls its weight.","218":"So far, these are working great. I've had them for a few months and they've been on a few camping trips. I like this size flashlight because they are easy to give to the kids and have them put them in their pockets. Big flashlights get set down, and forgotten.","219":"Small than expected, looks like a toy, not a real big torch.","220":"Very good little lights. Nice and bright. Need to buy more of them.","221":"Well one worked great , the other one did not work since day one, was not so bright and just went off. Got a new battery and turned on and then off. DEAD NOW...SO , I WOULD NOT BUY! DID I MENTION THAT WE got HIT BY MARIA? YEAH AND REALLY NEEDED IT!","222":"Very good.","223":"fantastic lights! great value super bright.","224":"These guys are perfect. I love their little size. And even though small they provide so much light. I love that I can spotlight or shine a large area. I am very satisfied and would order another one of these packs anytime!","225":"Highly potent beams, sturdy and compact, great flashligths.","226":"Great little flashlights for camping\/hiking. I kept one in my backpack for any emergency that might arise while hiking. And the other in the car to use at my campsites. I used the campsite flashlight EVERY night - it's small enough to comfortable fit in your pocket and bright enough to walk the dog and\/or walk to the bathroom in near complete darkness and only had to replace the battery once. The only complaint I have is that it seems to always rotate into strobe mode when I would turn it on - a little irritating, but not a deal breaker.","227":"Very bright and durable","228":"Great flashlights!","229":"perfect little flashlights!","230":"The price for these was great. For such a tiny item, they are very bright. Great in case of a hurricane when candles just won't do.","231":"Gooooooood","232":"fairly dim.\nalso you have to adjust the tension of the battery cap just so. if you tighten it all the way the flashlight wont function, usually. inconsistent.","233":"These are awesome, one has already started shorting out. Also be sure to have a spare battery with you!","234":"One of the flash light stop working after about a month to use. It seems like the switch problem to something internal. Not recommendable","235":"what a great deal","236":"One DOA, second one can't use button to turn light off.","237":"I was expecting too much out of these little guys. Ad says 300 lumens if im remembering correctly. Id say theyre more around 90-110lumens. 3\/4 have scratched lenses which isnt too much of an issue but considering theyre scratched on the inside, it could come as a concern to others.","238":"Expect what you pay for. These started malfunctioning after \u00b16 uses. Really cheaply made. Expect to have these break very fast.","239":"A very solid purchase, this flashlight blow my mind, I wasn't expecting a lot on this very small flashlight but i guess good things comes in small packages.","240":"Not bright at all but handy enough","241":"great value","242":"would not buy again. why to small. i guess i need to read description better or measure better. these are sooooo small. They work ok too but just to sarn small.","243":"Though these were cheap quality but they are metal and really brite.Very good item!","244":"It works as described. Does the job for me. Kids use it all the time and they're still intact. Batteries last decent amount of time so worth the money","245":"Great buy. Good price and they have three modes. Low high and sos. They also come with zoom that will allow more light and will put up a nice square when you pull the front on the flash light forward.","246":"these things put out a lotta light .","247":"Even though, the wide angle gives a decent spray of light. With a fresh battery, these lights struggled to light the bushes from 50 yards away. That does not mean if you want to use these babies in the attic, while checking the rat traps, you wont have great light, but when you zoom the lens for a tighter Beam... you'll find a \"square\" which is emitted by the LED module\/crystal. Which is okay, (for kids) but not great if you need to really see that \"thing\" that is right there... LOOKIN BACK AT YOU ...... All in all, this is great deal for a four pack of flashlights that you can give to the kids for a camping trip, to keep them all on the same wave, but if you're looking for something else to keep you out of the dark, and give yourself a chance to stay ahead of the critters... try something else.","248":"Bought these as back up flashlights for the recent hurricane season. They work great. Light weight. Good price.","249":"Bright, small, adjustable. I love these","250":"Very good, with high and low bright","251":"very good Item... My recomendation 100%... only used a Battery....","252":"Works as expected good product! A+","253":"Great product! Was very Impressed how much light they produce. Perfect for walking my dog at night. Feel a lot safer with these !!!!","254":"Superb quality, extremely bright flashlight at an astoundingly low price. You will NOT be disappointed. I have them all over the house and in every car...ended up buying 8 of them.","255":"good value","256":"Good quality construction, bright light, working with no issues, using for hiking, back packing and on the nightstand","257":"Great lights.","258":"VERY small in size (like 3 inches at most). Good for purses or kids backpacks.\nThey work well tho.","259":"weak","260":"Works fine for close up lighting but distance is a problem. Not the brightest either.","261":"Really great flashlights, very bright, well made, for an excellent price.","262":"So bright it can be used as a weapon","263":"Have to press the button repeatedly to cycle through the options.","264":"The build quality is great and they were very useful during Hurricane Harvey but one of the flashlight in the 2-pack was defective and is hard to get it working.","265":"Awesome flashlights!","266":"handy. don't know how long batteries last yet as they're still too new. :)","267":"One of the units does not work!!! It should be replaced . There was no info as to who to contact. All the others work well.","268":"I love these things. Such a steal for the price.","269":"I love them the,1 fo me and 1 for mom very bright!!","270":"good product","271":"Ok nothing spectacular","272":"Great lights","273":"Perfect","274":"Super bright and only takes one AA cell. Seems very sturdy.","275":"Great flash Light for a great price.","276":"Very bright and compact","277":"Great gifts","278":"Nice. Well made. Adjustable lens. Minimal packaging. Batteries not included.","279":"Great product!","280":"very good","281":"I thought the flashlight was good but I did not know that it flickers and I can\u2019t use it for the intended purpose, which is to seat guest in a performing arts center. Kind of disappointed","282":"I used this type of flashlights before (they are rather generic), and these also perform as well or better than many brand name units. One thing to make sure is to tighten the clip screws using thread locker, as those screws tend to get loose over time and my get lost rendering the clip useless.","283":"I got this in June of this year. After less than four months, it's broken. Something is rattling around inside, it won't zoom in all the way any more, and there are two rubber band like things that (I'm guessing) used to be inside the flashlight and are very likely related to why it isn't working any more. My work backpack has a pocket on the shoulder strap. It had been in that pocket for maybe a month before I discovered it had broken.\n\nThis flashlight is not rugged. Not even a little. If clipping it on an office worker's backpack for a month breaks something... Well let's just say I'm glad I didn't get into a situation where I was relying on this light. Very glad.\n\nOh, and nothing at all on this product offering about warranty, how to return it, etc. Honestly, I wouldn't accept a replacement. Only a refund.\n\nOne other and less important gripe: The pocket clip is way too rigid and is really hard to get on anything. That's why I put it on the pocket on my backpack shoulder strap. I couldn't even get the clip over the edge of my jeans pocket without using a tool to pry it open.\n\nMove on...get something else. Anything. A glow stick would be better and last longer.","284":"They work well, lightweight and somewhat powerful. They do the job. Good on the battery also.","285":"Very bright and good for the price!","286":"Very bright","287":"Works very well..","288":"The preformance and quality of these little flashlights is amazing. I haven't used one long enough to expend the single AA cell but the amount of light they put out from 1.5 volts defies belief. The color temperature is higher (bluer) than I would like for longer duration use, their small size makes up for that in convenience and their billet aluminum housing is as rugged as more expensive competitors","289":"Unable to open battery cap of flashlights. Contacted supplier, still no response. Worst Product & Service.","290":"Very dim. Not worth the money.","291":"One would not work. Amazon returned it. Don\u2019t like the strobe light function.","292":"Very Bright and very portable. Love that it comes in a two pack. Would purchase again.","293":"Great price, small and very bright- Easy fit in any pocket One can't have too many flashlights","294":"For the price, these flashlights are great. They seem very durable as well.","295":"I was about to give it two stars since I was so sad that I lost one but then I realized that was silly. These are so bright and small! Great for camping or anything. Solid construction. Batteries haven't died. I'll buy more of these if I need more flashlights.","296":"Right size. Easy to store in small emergency bag.","297":"Works great. I like having only one AA batter to replace.","298":"One works great and the other has a disfunction when trying to use the \u201cspot light.\u201d It won\u2019t stay in place and I manually have to hold it.","299":"Not as bright as the Solaray one I have. These always want to start out flashing so I have to remember to push button twice.","300":"Excellent flashlight. Puts out a lot of light from a compact, durable body, uses only a single AA battery.","301":"Nice","302":"update. both flashlights have ceased working after less than a month. so the verdict is","303":" do not buy this product.\n\nfantastic little flashlight!! very bright and love the zoom feature. I use it to walk dogs in the dark and it is perfect.","304":"Sending tons of these al9ng with batteries and led lamps to 0yerto Rico. Folks having sone seruoys power issues there.","305":"Great lights! Extremely bright. The cost makes these quite the bargain. I placed one in each of my cars. I plan on buying more to put in my squad car for an emergency, and to carry while I am on duty. By far the brightest light I have ever owned for the size.","306":"nice flashlight for the value.....","307":"This was a great buy and they work well. Good to keep in the car glove box.","308":"They're bright but very small. Gets the job done tho","309":"Terrific lights you can carry for a walk, etc. Fits in your pocket. Recommended.","310":"Great little flashlight. Bright and adjustable for close up or distance.","311":"I really liked these...so did the repairmen in my home as they walked away with the two I owned! Great gift for a man apparently!","312":"This is a pair of solidly constructed, bright mini flashlights.\n\nPlan to leave one home and use the other for travel.","313":"Great","314":"super bright, and very handy. great buy for under $10","315":"These flashlights are the BOMB! Love their size and brilliant light. Reminds me of the flashlight seen on the tv show CSI.","316":"For the money - these are very good little flashlights. Slightly bulky to carry in a pants pocket. Easy to carry in a purse, pack, coat pocket, or car. I use these with the mini butterball 14500 batteries. The total cost for the flashlights, batteries, and charger is about $20 for two. I like the strobe mode for use as an emergency signal. My only \"beef\" with the flashlight industry in general is the black color. Seriously? The point of a flashlight is to improve visibility in the darkness. Try finding a jet black flashlight during a power outage! Flashlights should be neon yellow or orange. I don't care what they look like. I want something I can easily find and use. Please stop making black colored flashlights or provide options.","317":"It was just as described","318":"Bought them because who wouldn't want to have a tactical flash light for about $7? My friends and I laughed that we all had one for the same reason lol Until I had to use it during Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, it is a really good product.","319":"All six flashlights worked perfectly out of the box and allows us to have quality flashlights in multiple rooms around the house. They are easy to use and provide sufficient light despite their small form factor.","320":"These are very sturdy, durable flashlights. They are also decently bright with two different light settings. Would definitely recommend.","321":"Small but very bright. Bought four and keep in various places around house!","322":"These are great","323":"So I was hoping for a durable metal flashlight that had better than average candle power. What I got was essentially a $3 flashlight with a metal casing.\nFirst impressions were it was alittle lighter than I imagined.\nThe light was not even that bright. I dug out a $1.99 Harbor Freight LED flashlight and compared the 2 on my basement wall. The H Freight one out shined the Rockbird one easily. Not terrible enough to junk or return, a small metal casing flashlight could come in handy.\n\nBut when I need a bright light, I wont be reaching for this","324":"Pure crap! They end up in garbage can two days after arrival. Very low quality.","325":"I donated these to people that needed them in Texas for the hurricane. I am sure they are getting used","326":"Very bright and efficient. Easy to use.","327":"Awesome little flashlights. Super powerful and bright. Would recommend.","328":"Good light at cheap price","329":"Very good lights use them to look into computers and copiers. Came in real handy during the tropical storm..","330":"Super bright light in a small package.","331":"These are extremely tiny, they fit in the palm of my tiny lady hands but they are powerful and work great....I just want people to know because the picture can be deceiving. I would still recommend these as I use them alot.","332":"Overall a very useful light. However be aware that it chews up AA batteries. Battery life is frankly awful.","333":"Powerful little handheld flashlights and extremely useful to have! They come in handy and I have them in several rooms, my car and tucked away where I would need them inthe dark. Easy to carry, they are unobtrusive so make it very easy to stash them.","334":"Good little lites! A bit cheaply made, however, you can't beat the price!","335":"Theses are very nice soon buy some more","336":"Great deal on a 4 pack. Light works good.","337":"Great deal and very small and compact. Easily fits in a pocket or car glove box. Extremely bright!","338":"They work great and it only takes one battery but it is nothing special","339":"Nice value! Decent flashlights.","340":"Well made, really inexpensive","341":"Great deal","342":"Good product","343":" sweet deal($)","344":" quick delivery.","345":"Very well made aluminum lights for a great price.","346":"Excellent quality.","347":"Excellent flashlight and a very good value.","348":"Arrived in perfect condition, on time. Each one works great. Very happy. Have them scattered around the house.","349":"Great flash light","350":"Very solidly made. Very bright and the beam is easily changed from concentrated to broad by sliding the lens. Runs on one AA battery which is easy to change. The LED is easily changed as well if needed. There were two in the package. The main problem is that there are three modes: bright, dim and bright strobe and you need to cycle thru all of them to get to the one you want. Every time you turn it on. It does not stay on the last mode used.","351":"Best of the best, use regular AA battery, just one battery. Similar flashlight I had in the past use 3.7v battery. Pain in the neck to get one. So I discarded. This one is the best. I am giving it as a gift to many people. Thanks for designing with common sense battery.","352":"I use the flashlight with a 14500 battery. The flashlight works well - however one of the 2 flashlights has failed - I guess you get what you pay for","353":"These are very nice, sturdy little flashlights, and it's hard to beat the price. They might not be as bright as other flashlights, but they certainly put out enough light for my needs.","354":"these are decent lights for the price but are not 300 lumens more like 100. compared it to a 125 lumens I already have and its not even as bright","355":"Great for the kids camping trips. Light is bright!","356":"Bright light! Happy with it.","357":"Great for suitcases, cars, etc., while traveling","358":" we now have 5 of them for our travels.","359":"Best yet","360":"Delighted with this 6-pack of small, VERY bright flashlights.\nOnly minor quibble is that it's unclear when pressing the \"On\" button will turn on a solid light, versus turning on a rapidly-flashing light.\n(Apparently the flashing light - which may or may not come on - is to confuse all those terrible criminals that are trying to attack you ... 'cause, you know, you're so likely to face that \"tactical\" situation.)\nOther quibblette is that it'd be nice to be able to remove the pocket-clip (but it's attached with 2 unusual screws). On the other hand, if it was removed, then the flashlight would roll freely on any surface on which one might lay it - which would NOT be \"desirable\". So, at least the pocket-clip keeps the otherwise completely round flashlight from rolling when layed-down.\nAll in all, I LIKE 'em - a LOT! :-)","361":"Theyre flashlights, not incredible, not bad.","362":"Nice, bright little flashlight for the money. I bought a couple to have on hand for power outages and I think these will be just what I need (although I have larger, camping lantern style lights if I need to light a bigger area).","363":"does not work","364":"Great Quality ... Very durable","365":"I love them , very compact and bright light.","366":"I bought these (2) when they were only $8 They are such a great value and only take one AA battery.","367":"Poor quality. I thought these would be pretty decent, like the J5 tactical flashlights, but they are not. The reflector and insides of one has already come apart and is not easily repairable.","368":"For the price I paid I expected to be no so tough, but they have lasted so far, and the light they provide is very bright, my only complain one of them had a defective switch, but was an easy task to tear it apart and fix it.","369":"I typically do not write reviews, but I was impressed when I put in a AA battery. Very small flashlight, but super bright. I did not notice a big difference in brightness between the spray view and the focused view, but there could be a difference in distance (just guessing). My purpose for these was to be prepared during power outages and to maybe use while camping. I am buying some more soon. I could see these as a nice gift.","370":"Amazing little lights. Very bright and well made.Incredibly inexpensive for what you get.","371":"I like these little light, bought for the tool box, and are bright,","372":"Very bright and compact. Work great around the grill.","373":"Nice sized, bright flashlights. They have 3 settings - bright, dim and strobe, and you can adjust the lens so it either floods or is very narrow. You really can't beat them for the price, and the form factor is great for throwing one in a drawer, one in your truck, etc.\n\nAlso running on only 1 AA battery is nice! Battery is not included though.","374":"Love these little lights. Super bright. The strobe light can be used as a defensive weapon. It totally can slow someone down.","375":"It is bright for a little flashlight. I always have it with me. I keep one in the car and one in my bag. I would buy this one again.","376":"Very bright and compact","377":"Great product","378":"Excellent pocket or purse protection. We ordered these for the hurricane season. Perfect.","379":"Works great, small, light and bright,","380":"Good little lights for the money.","381":"I\u2019m actually surprised the amount of lights it puts out... and the ability to change the focus is amazing... Lowell made and compact.... After receiving the flashlight, I end up ordering another pair... try it and you won\u2019t be disappointed...","382":"very bright. Love the AA battery size. I assume it can burn for many hours?","383":"Bright. 3 settings, strobe, bright and dim. Can focus light smaller.","384":"Wow these work great, can't believe you get 2","385":"One worked and the other would not.","386":"I'm really glad I got these. I keep one in the kitchen (for finding equipment in all the dark corners of cabinets) and one next to the attic door (I'm afraid I use the attic as kind of an extended storage closet). They're very bright and I particularly like the ability to broaden or narrow the beam. They're generally all-around handy for those of us with poor vision who need an extra boost of light at times. They're also great for finding a pet that's hiding from you because it doesn't want it's medicine.","387":"Weird it doesn't come with batteries","388":"Nice bright light. And it's cool that you can widen or narrow the beam, depending on the situation. Very happy with them.","389":"The small flash lights are just what we needed. They work just fine.","390":"works good. Love that it takes 1 AA and its pretty bright for what it is.","391":"Light does not go on sometimes and sometimes it switches itself into strobe mode on its own.","392":"One of the two lights had a defective switch. The one working light is lower quality than similar products I have seen, but is bright enough. I like the size and that it takes just one AA battery. I'll keep this in my office for emergency use during power outages.","393":"They ran all night during hurricane Irma. Really did the job! Great quality.","394":"Great little light","395":" good beam quality","396":" heavy duty case.","397":"I'd gotten these previously and it was time to get a few more.\n\nI was happy with the initial batch but while they're intelligently designed, the quality of the last batch I got wasn't great. 2 of the 4 didn't function properly. Though I will say the price is pretty exceptional.","398":"after the First time using the flashlight it fell out of my pocket and it hasnt worked since.","399":"These seem solid and good quality. However after using for one camping trip (right out of the box) the power button\/mode selector on the flashlight has developed a short. It is indecisive on whether or not it will turn on at all when clicked, and the half click to change modes guarantees it shuts off and you're hard pressed to get it to turn back on again. I should have been thorough about putting these through the paces during the return window before trying to rely on them.","400":"Very bright, neat can hold on a keyring very helpful around the home etc.","401":"This flashlight deal is a steal! This light put out a strong beam for its size and its very durable. I am a locksmith and this has become my everyday flashlight. It works great and the magnification is such a helpful thing. I would highly highly recommend this product because the brightness, durability and the cost. Get you one and i promise you will not regret it!","402":"Neither flashlight worked. Checked my batteries in another light , problem with Rockbirds flashlight ,","403":"Honestly not worth it I tried to use them for work and they worked half the time. The light would randomly start to change then just stop working. Just stay away from these","404":"They are okay, but not very bright if only using regular batteries. Don't get these unless you want to invest in the extra powerful battery\/charger. This doesn't put out nearly the light that the duracell 350 puts out with 4 aaa batteries(I use rechargables)","405":"Great product at a great price!","406":"Very small flashlights but they work well. I would have given a full 5 stars but one of them wanted to be annoying and not work 100% of the time. The light exposure was great, it gave a lot of bright light. They only take 1 AA battery which is great. I purchased a 24 pack of AA's with these flashlights- both were a good purchase.","407":"nice and bright","408":"Great little flashlights with good power and variable light beam to fit different situations. They were very useful and efficient in a power outage during a hurricane. I ordered two more.","409":"Bought before hurricane Irma. Wanted led flashlights. Small enough to fit in pocket. They were exactly what we needed , as our power was off several days.\nDon't overlook this pair of mini flashlights. They do the job.","410":"These ended up being very handy, but I didn't realize how small they would be. To be fair to the manufacturer I probably didn't grasp what the dimensions they posted really meant so it's in. I way their fault. For those of you who are not as found of math or lack basic sense of spatial awareness (like me), these little guys are about palm size. Maybe a little smaller or bigger depending on your body proportions, but that's my best comparison out the gate.\n\nAll that being said these are some nifty flashlights. They have a bright, medium, and strobe setting which you change by halfway pressing the power button. I found that out a bit of a startling way, but was none the less impressed. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.","411":"These flashlights had high and low beam as well flashers...my only complaint their size..looking at the picture,I was expecting something bigger.","412":"Awesome flashlights! Definitely recommend!","413":"Perfect little flashlight. Feels very durable and rugged. Has three settings: bright, less bright, and strobe. Runs on a single battery, so it's cheap and easy to use.","414":"No durability, both of them broke quickly after purchase.","415":"Surprisingly small flashlights, but work great and are very bright. Like the option to focus or in focus (spread the beam) the light.","416":"Not as bright as expected. One very irritating feature is that pressing the ON button cycles through the flashlight's modes. So, whenever you turn it on, it turns on in low light, strobe, or high (in that order).","417":"These are great, light up the night, need to order 8 more!","418":"NOT REAL BRIGHT","419":"Very happy with my purchase! They are tiny metal\nmagic flashlights as they illuminate so much light!!!\nPerfect feeling in your hand and great for kids as well! Three modes: bright light, refular light and strobing ligh.","420":"Pretty brigt for their size","421":"good lights and feel sturdy but way smaller than expected.","422":"Excellent flashlight! Love it. Very bright. Requires only one battery. Would buy more if needed.","423":"A little bummed at how fast it's draining the battery, but it is very bright. Loving the bright and dim modes but kind of hating the strobe. I guess if you have a BYO strobe party it's cool or you have to defend yourself against a racoon, but otherwise it's another button you have to push to get to bright mode again","424":"These are totally unreliable. Most of the time they don't On when you need them to.","425":"Great product.","426":"Incredible product for 9.99. I have rechargeable batteries and bought these because of hurricane Irma but the power save mode is much appreciated. It is very bright and the ability to focus the light if you need too is very helpful too. They are a little small (pocket sized) but they are quite strong. Like I said, incredible product for 9.99 ($5 each flashlight)","427":"Best frickin lil light at great price you can see 300 feet in the dark I have bought over 20 of them . JUST AWESOME PRODUCT","428":"Bought these to put in my hurricane preparedness kit. They are ok. They feel solid, and the brightness is fine. However, when I put in the battery and tightened the cap the light came on and stayed on despite depressing the button. I loosened the cap a bit and it worked properly, but it seems like a design flaw. Not the best flashlight I've purchased, but I got two for $9.00, so for the price they are ok.","429":"Great product, well worth the money....","430":"Based on the good reviews, I bought this pack of two flashlights in preparation for Hurricane Irma, as I live in Central Florida. One of the two in the pack is defective. The on\/off switch does not work so that the light shines as soon as the battery is in and it cannot be turned off without taking out the battery.","431":"they are not as bright as I thought it would be but it's still a great price for the amount of flashlights you receive","432":"I wasn't expecting much out of these and bought them as a quick fix for a camping trip, but I ended up loving them and I'll use them for more than camping! It's great that they only take one AA battery and the light is still quite bright. The clip is handy, and they feel much more durable than I was expecting.","433":"Horrible lights!! The lights change modes with any bump of the flashlight. I cannot keep them on one mode without them changing modes from power saving to flashing to high beam. Every single bump or vibration will change modes and cause the lid to come off and the battery pop off! Cheap and not worth the money!","434":"Wonderful and very bright product for the price.","435":"Great for the pocket and traveling","436":"These are great little lights and put out a big adjustable magnified beam. They last about 3 years before switch or other problems develop but worth every bit of the money paid.","437":"Nice","438":"One of the four flashlights doesn't work. The others are fine, but disappointing to have one be defective. Actually,a second one has stopped working. I am going to see if I can contact the seller.","439":"Very unhappy with these -- they feel cheap, and one looks like it's been damaged. And now I find out that I can't return them.","440":"Great little flashlights, make good gifts. Sturdy and provide bright light.","441":"No returns and that's no good","442":"Good flashlight for a price.","443":"Small flashlights with okay light. Not something I'd use except maybe to find my way to the bathroom in the middle of the night","444":"I ordered these last week and after putting a battery in the first one thought it seemed like a good product, especially liking the small size. I tried putting a battery in the second one and it will not close. Apparently the grooves are stripped so it will not hold the end which secures the battery. I tried to return and today discovered they are NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN so I have one flashlight instead of two. I am wondering how long this one will last.","445":"These lights have a nice, solid feel to them. I like'em. I have not used them much so I can't comment on the operational quality. All too often, cheap flashlights tend to start having problems with the on\/off buttons or you have to smack them to get the light to turn on. We'll see how these hold up.","446":"Nice little flashlight. A lot of light for something this size. Definitely worth the price.","447":"One of the flashlights worked great right out of the box. The second light had an issue with the focusing collar. Extending the collar took a greater amount of effort over the first one and it snapped back upon releasing it. If there's an o-ring inside, it's too snug and is creating vacuum on extension. It doesn't snap back all the way leaving about one-eighth inch gap. The only way I could retract it all the way was by rotating the collar as I pressed down and as I pulled up. Eventually I could fully extend it and retract it with no issues. The same flashlight had a short issue with the switch. One day upon pressing the on-off button it flashed on momentarily then remained off. Pushing down on the button had no effect and the switch would not lock in position. It wouldn't even rotate to the next position. I Removed the switch portion from the main body and tapped it on a table and tried pressing again. No change. I eventually screwed the switch back figuring that it was broken. After screwing it back on I tried pushing the button one last time. It worked again! Probably some debris inside the switch worked free. I was going to ask the seller for a new switch as the problem could occur again at some inconvenient future time.","448":"two small flashlights that light things you point at.","449":"They work great.","450":"Handy little things to have around the house and in the car. Very bright.","451":"these babies are bright and do not really go through the batteries. Great price on this two pack.","452":"Nice small and handy flashlights. I kept one myself (always in my pocket), gave one to my wife and one to my grown-up son, and am keeping one in my car. Will be handy during very likely upcoming (now as the temperature has hit 100F) power outage and soon approaching Fall season's power outages.","453":"For $4.50? This is nuts. One for each car.","454":"I got them today n love them. Small n handy. I put one in my daughters car","455":"Flashlights are ok better than I expected can't really beat 2 flashlights for the price only had for a few days but so far so good.\n2nd review haven't had the flash lights longs and starting to not work thought was good first 2 weeks then work half the time","456":"These are great. Experienced a power outage. We're very helpful.","457":"A must for everyone. Works very well","458":"They aren't very bright and only turn on half the time. Don't waste your money.","459":"One of them, the threads holding the battery cap in, stripped the first time that I took it off.","460":"These work even when repeatedly submerged under water about 12\" deep. Good for dealing with emergencies, floods, surf fishing...","461":"These flashlights aren't as bright as I expected, but they work. I don't really like how each press of the power button cycles through the three settings (bright, dim, flashing). When I press the power, I expect it to always start on the bright setting, but it doesn't. It goes to whatever setting was next in the rotation. It's not a big deal, but it's a little annoying.\n\nI would give these 3 stars, but the good price point bumps it up to 4. I didn't pay much for these, so they're mostly worth the price. I have another small flashlight I much prefer, but it was also a lot more expensive.","462":"Opened the box, grabbed one of the flashlights, twisted the top off, placed the battery. Seemed to work pretty good. Then, I grabbed the other flashlight, twisted the... twisted the stuck top, pull the top, WD40 the top, twist the top while holding the body with pliers, threw in trash. The top was welded on and stripped so badly there was nothing I could do to open it and place the battery. If you're going to seal it shut, at least provide the battery. Ridiculous.","463":"These are amazingly good little flashlights. Ten stars for the set!","464":"Don't buy these little flashlights. When I got them one of the button on the back of the flashlight doesn't work and this product did not allow returns.","465":"Fair value, very cheap and functional.","466":"Work well, good for the vehicle.","467":"After a power outage, I decided we needed more flashlights available. The cheap 9 LED flashlights just didn't cut it and it was a lot of trouble having to insert three batteries into the flashlight cartridge. I have only tried out one Rockbird but the results were good. It isn't the most powerful flashlight around but it does the job. It puts out plenty of light and inserting one AA battery is very easy. For general use, it is a very good flashlight. My only con is that it is black and hard to find in the dark and in dark drawers. Wish I was able to get them in silver.","468":"Perfect size for purse or glove box. Great for carrying on night walks. Would give 5 star but i prefer sa wrist strap added.","469":"Handy little flashlights and I thought the clip would be great for for those times I don't happen to have pockets. So far I found that the metal bar is so tight that I can't it to clip on any clothing and I am afraid to pry it open too far in case it snaps off.\n\nI also received one that was great and one that was significantly dimmer. Can't blame the batteries as I switched them out with the same results.\n\nIf they were both the same intensity I would rate them 5 stars.","470":"Nice, durable flashlights that are surprisingly very bright. This was a great addition to my emergency pack.","471":"it is a bright,durable and cheap little light perfect for camping and the like. i even used as an ice hammer when i forgot to close the lid on my ice chest and the top layer froze solid. still works btw","472":"Bright, well built, handy little flashlights. Easy to carry in one's pocket. Like that they only need a single AA battery.","473":"Good quality for the price. Feel sturdy.","474":"Incredibly bright! Don't waste your money on flash lights that take AAA batteries. These take just","475":"Excellent. Just what I needed.","476":"kinda small but will update when we go camping this thursday!","477":"Thank you very much.","478":"Great item as expected","479":"I like it","480":"Great light","481":"A OK flashlight for the price good for fishing hunting and outdoor activities Like the fact that it's made with a metal material very bright Love the belt clip Good product","482":"Great little flashlight. It works well and is very bright for its size.","483":"Very bright, well made, I like that it only uses one battery. Small enough to fit in my pocket. I use it for dog walks at night. It lights up the ground very well and has a decent light projection for being so some. It was a very good buy.","484":"The lights are great LED lights. They came in handy during a recent camping trip and a late night going trip. Great Bargain!!","485":"These things are junk. They work for about 2 minutes and then they die. Not battery dead just dead. Don't waste your money","486":"nlce flashligh like the fact aa battery","487":"Great product","488":"Small and powerful...just like me :)","489":"I installed the batteries and they both worked great.","490":"Great flashlight. Great price!","491":"I bought these flashlights to keep in the glove box of both cars to use in case of an emergency. They both failed only after using them several times. The product is garbage and i threw both of them away. Not even worth the hassle of packaging them back up to send back. You get what you pay for I guess.","492":"Nice light.","493":"One worked fine but the other heated up to an unsafe temperature, hot enough we removed the battery and disposed of it. If we had left it much longer it could have been seriously bad news.","494":"Great for the price!","495":"These little guys are rugged, durable, functional, and easy to use. Great purchase! Especially for the price, you cant go wrong.","496":"Blinding light one battery love it","497":"Not as expected","498":"Nice little flashlights.","499":"Was really excited for these lights. Poor quality the on\/off button on one is failing it doesn't turn on and the others internals aren't holding together where it should slide to zoom very disappointed in this product.","500":"The flashlights haven't been very durable. The back button get's kind of finicky where you have to click it several times for it to turn back on.","501":"Awesome Product works really good.","502":"For the price, fantastic product.","503":"Awesome light and wicked bright","504":"love the AA, bright, use it everyday","505":"Good","506":"Not as bright I thought it would have but works good.","507":"Small and bright! Excellent!","508":"Thought they would be larger but works good..","509":"perfect","510":"OMG","511":" who would buy regular flashlights anymore? LED is the new bright light.... These LED Flashlights are so amazing an they last FOREVER!","512":"Exactly as described, and more. Well engineered item, water resistant 100%. Super bright white beam. Battery easy to replace. I will buy again - these make excellent gifts for friends and family (just make sure you order them some AmazonBasic AA batteries too :-)","513":"These are pretty nifty flashlights! They are super bright but still nice and small. They seem to be very well made.","514":"For the price these are very nice and worth it. They easily compete with my more expensive Fenix flashlights. I can't speak to battery life yet though. I am definitely happy so far with them. I will update this review if they break down or die quickly.","515":"i like this flashlight, its size and weight are perfect for its performance","516":"Bright as can be. Best survival kit addition. You should buy two of these sets. One for your back pack, one for you car, one for your apartment, and one for your travel bag. Seriously a great flashlight to carry along with you, everywhere. Very bright, focused and wide light adjustments, and durable!\n\nBuy buy buy! Ok Bye","517":"Compact and solid","518":"Great little flashlights!","519":"These are great... great size, excellent beam. Used them while camping.","520":"These are cheap knockoffs of a more quality product. Not very bright. Not worth the money.","521":"Used around 10 times, already stopped working, when you can get it to turn on it goes from high to low to flashing all by its self!","522":"I wish they had come with some instructions, but one can figure it out. Bright light, great for small places, like a car or purse, and easy to tuck ito a pocket for an evening walk.","523":"Good Deal.","524":"It would've been nice if you could've adjusted the size of the light ? But still enjoy the light.","525":"Awesome","526":"Nice - in past flash lights crapped out after a few months - corroded with white stuff inside...will see how these do..","527":"Perfect size for evening walks! Nice and bright for the size!","528":"Great Flashlight","529":"They don't work. I bought them for a trip and they don't work. What a waste of money","530":"perfect","531":"Great little flashlights!!!","532":"very good","533":"Got both light and was excited about them (from the description) one would not hold batteries because the threads were stripped. The other would not zoom\/focus light the description stated it could \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Very disappointing to say the least","534":"Very good very good","535":"Nice flashlights. Seem to be durable and perfect fit for a pocket.","536":"Bright light and inexpensive.","537":"Small and very bt\\right.","538":"Good, sturdy, bright flashlight.","539":"Never can have enough flashlights!","540":"One out of 4 light was bad, other than that was ok.","541":"came as a 2 pack one flashlight only turns on in dim mode, flash and high mode no longer work, was used on two or three times. The second one still works","542":"works great.","543":"good","544":"they did not come with any info.","545":"Good size, great intensity","546":"Excellent flashlights.","547":"Great flashlight just wish you didn't have to cycle through the modes everytime.","548":"One does not work.","549":"This small flashlight is small and shines very bight. Great deal for 2 Flashlights!","550":"Great, powerful little flashlight that can focus its beam. Seems solid and sturdy.","551":"Perfect size for my purse.","552":"Excellent value.","553":"Flashlight would not turn off and almost burned my hand. It seems there is a short and the battery power is turned into heat in the handle!","554":"they are very useful","555":"Great Value","556":"I like this flashlight, they are very bright and focus adjustable. Compare with MINI MAGLITE, this is very good and save more using 1 AA battery compare with the other brands. I recommend it.","557":"The light is super Bright for its size. I am not sure how long it last on 1 set of batteries yet. I wish it had a rechargeable battery option so I gave it a 4 star.","558":"one worked one did not work","559":"good little and bright light","560":"for the price its worth it. no batteries included.","561":"This is an incredibly cool flashlight. Very powerful for the size. Impressed with quality. Great deal!","562":"I bought these in lightening deal not entirely realizing the compact size (my husband is a flashlight fanatic). Wow, was I ever excited to open these up and realizing they fit into my dog walking bag. It's also a nice compact size to stash in my center console. Needless to say, hubby hasn't gotten one finger on these flashlights. These are mine, all mine.","563":"Good bang for the dollar.","564":"Great price for the same basic light I had purchased for a higher price from another vendor. Excellent! Small, lightweight and light stream can be narrow or wide angle.","565":"Complete junk. Worked for like a day","566":"they are cool","567":"As arrived, upon inserting the battery, the flashlight didn't turn on. Only 1 of the flashlights worked. The second flashlight, trash.","568":"These mini LED flashlights are perfect for my little ones to use while we are out camping. They are heavy duty yet light and water resistant so they can withstand the rain (it always rains while camping). With these you have the ability to focus and adjust the intensity of light. There are 3 different modes: high beam, low beam and flashing and it only takes one AA battery. My son loves the handy built-in clip","569":" he can clip the flashlight to his pant pocket, on his shirt or where ever it fancies him. Only flaw to me is that the clip is quite stiff so it can be difficult trying to clip it on but it definitely stays in place. Overall, these are great, sturdy little lights for the money. You get alot of light from such a small flashlight.","570":"Good flashlights so far. touch design. bright light.","571":"Bought two of these...liked them enough to order four more. Recently opened a two pack of the second ones I ordered. Good light overall not great. Disappointed to find out one flashlight doesn't work out of the box brand new. Would've given five stars based on the value. Not an extremely bright light but better than average considering price. They also burn through AAA batteries quickly. Can't get past only getting half of what I paid for...that kills the value part that compensated for the average brightness.","572":"Too small for regular use. They are listed as mini though.","573":"This was a daily deal. Gave one to my husband-he loves it.","574":"Good cheap flashlight.","575":"The light is much brighter when you use 14500 3.7 v battery.","576":"The flashlight description stated online does not match the actual product. The product zoom is COMPLETELY different as stated in the pictures shown as what it actually does. Will keep flashlight, but not happy description and actually product functions do not match!!!","577":"These are cery good flashlights and exactly what I expected. Flashlight doesnt stay on the same mode when turning off and on, but they do have a bright, dim, and strobe, and you can change the mode with a half push of the button while it is on.","578":"Got a good deal on these $5 s piece, are very bright, or dimmer battery saving mode as well as strobe.","579":"Bought as a gift.","580":"Not bad. One of them doesn't turn on anymore, and not sure why. Battery is good, and all connections seem good. ???","581":"Only one out of the two worked. Something in the switching mechanism that turns the light on and off did not work.","582":"At first I was going to give it 1 star....Upon opening my package, I see this tiny box. No way that's 1 flashlight, let alone 2. I open the tiny box and see 2 tiny flashlights. Great, I got ripped off. I put in a battery to try one out just for the hell of it. Was I wrong.....these tiny things are sweet. They pack as much light power as a bigger flashlight I have, which looks similar. These are great for BOB or EDC equipment. I might even buy a couple more.","583":"Wish they were brighter. Have been very helpful around the house to look in dark closets or searching for things in the car. Good product.","584":"Awesome produced, you will not be disappointed.","585":"only one of the two i received works correctly. one of them does the hi and lo and strobe. the other one shines a light only. china...","586":"Totally worth the price. Much brighter than the LED flashlights you buy at the checkout counter for the same price and this needs just 1aa battery rather than 3aaa like the checkout counter models. These are tiny -FYI. They fit in your palm so don't expect something bigger. Great little lights. I bought 2 just to check them out. Now I'll order the six pack and stash them all over.\n\nJust ordered 4 more. They arrived and work great.","587":"I was so impressed by the first set that I ordered a second set. Will make a great Christmas gift. Heavy duty and great lighting.","588":"This didn't work at all when I got them and they didn't refund me the price I paid\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude10","589":"Bright light","590":"these lights work great nice and bright good to keep in auto just incase thx","591":"compact and work great.","592":"I don't like the modes that it forces you to cycle through. I have to click through dim and flasher modes before I get to the regular bright mode which is all I wanted in the first place. For the price it's a marginally ok product.","593":"Best damn little 5 buck flashlight for EDC I like the nuts that are on the outside holding the clip on, several other types I've had used screws but screws require very small driver to tighten, these any pliers and your good to go again, the light with 1 AA gives almost as much as the NEBO I\nhave that requires 3 AAAs strobe and multiple intensity beams all work very well. My only critique would be for a slightly less stiff clip it definitely stays on but requires an assist to clip on, or take out of pocket","594":"These flashlights are AMAZING and so portable and bright!","595":"work great, super handy.","596":"Excellent quality and workmanship!","597":"The only problem was there is no manual instruction.","598":"these are super bright, need only one common AA battery. fit easily in glove box or center console of car. they don't weigh hardly anything so I imagine ideal for a purse as well. I'd purchase again in the future","599":"Quick shipping.\nFlash light is week compared to other 300 lumens flash lights. This may be due to the fact that it uses a single AA battery.\nNot recomended.","600":"OMG! I love these flash lights! I originally I got these for my survival kit. I put one in my survival pack and the other one in my purse. I use the one in my purse all the time! My purse is so big, I loose things! Lol!","601":"These are as good as any light I have used. I live in the woods and they light up the country side. I have one on my shotgun and it works great.\nSuper compact size allows for east carry and mounting on a weapon.","602":"These flashlights are not actually 300lumens. They are not even 200 lumens. When compared to other 300 lumen and a 200 lumen flashlight I found that with new batteries at its highest setting folly zoomed in, was still visibly dimmer than the 200 lumen flashlight. I bought the two pack, and compared both to each other with both new alkaline and fully charged nickle-cadmium rechargeable batteries and found that they do not even match each other in brightness. They're inexpensive, and were the compact size I was looking for, but it seems you get what you pay for, and in this case you pay for under 200 lumens.","603":"One works fine, the other was DOA","604":"More than I expected. Got these for 5 dollars a piece.","605":"This item for 10 dollars is so worth it!!! Feels like I'm using a 100 dollar flashlight so worth it ordering more!!!!!","606":"Worked well and were priced well. The lights are bright, they include a strobe light and a wide to narrow beam focus and a belt clip. They are made well from sturdy metal with no plastic parts.","607":"Good value and quality. perfect for my needs","608":"One failed within 5 days.the on off switch stopped working","609":"Got two of these on deal of the day. I should have bought a dozen and stashed them everywhere. They work great and are small enough to use wherever a light is needed. Very intense for a small light.","610":"I did not expect much from this light at this price, but I did expect it to last longer than one day. It did not.","611":"I got a 2 pack on sale for like 8$. These are incredible little lights and being adjustable can focus on at a distance.","612":"little rust inside and poor quality","613":"great item","614":"Just received these today. So far so good, not super bright but not bad either. They feel a little \"flimsy\" so not sure how long they will hold up. About what you'd expect for $9, definitely wouldn't spend more than that.","615":"I purchased the 2 pack. They arrived quickly. Only take 1 AA battery and it was easy to install. I bought them so I could keep one in my cars glovebox and one either on me or in my apt. For the price they are perfect. Heavy duty housing that doesn't feel cheap. Also has strobe function.","616":"This flashlight is like having your own personal automobile headlight. set to high beam. Very bright flashlight and barely the size of you pinky finger, incredible!!","617":"tiny flashlights big area of light! A++","618":"Does not return to bright after powering off, full clicks cycle through modes the same way that half-clicks do. Brightness seems below what is advertised. Will likely return.","619":"these flashlights are awesome!","620":"Incredibly dim. The rubber on the button is warped and bubbled. I found metal shavings in the threading of the battery chamber. Did I mention that it is so dim it's pathetic? I was going to give this as a gift but after trying it out I would be so ashamed if I had given it. Other than the metal shavings, warped rubber button and a pretty poor battery fit it does feel like it does feel like it is a well built flashlight, too bad that its so weak at actually producing light.","621":"The flashlights were defective when received. One could not be opened to insert a battery. Cheap and unreliable.","622":"I know they were not expensive. One unit works great. It will be good for my tool box at work. The other .. the lens is messed up and not half as bright as the first. So in closing 50\/50 dosnt work for me.","623":"To be honest, I'm not impressed. I'm comparing these to my Streamlight Protac, which is also 300 lumens.\n\nFirstly, at first glance the construction seems fine. Quality of materials is ok.\n\nSecondly, there is no way in Hell that these flashlights are 300 lumens. I'd wager that they aren't even 100 lumens. Not bright at all.","624":"SUPER BRIGHT COMPACT","625":"i was really surprised how bright they were and they only take 1 AA battery per flashlight","626":"Very bright light, non adjustable beam","627":"I work at a hospital, at night. These work perfect when I don't want to disturb my patients and wake them up with a bright light. They are so cute and fit in my pocket of my uniform. I also keep one in my purse.","628":"VERY Bright lights for the cost. Plus uses common AA Batteries.","629":"Only received one light in my order. The one light is nice for the price but I paid for two","630":"ty...I like","631":"Bright, nice portable size. they fit in my glove box.","632":"They are small yet brilliant light. Great product!","633":"One of the three flashlights did not work","634":"Not too bad for the price I paid. They are bright. The area where the battery goes is a little hard to turn, but still worked just fine.","635":"Overall love the light. Only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me is that switching the modes around can be a pain because it switches the mode as soon as it is turned off.","636":"Nice bright little LED flashlights, can't beat them for the price, love the adjust-ability and the different light modes.","637":"Work good. Batteries last a long time. Really bright","638":"Perfect","639":"Great, sturdy little light for the money. A lot of light from such a small flashlight.","640":"Excelente producto","641":"Husband loves them.","642":"Uses just one AA battery, features adjustable beam by sliding the front part with the lens.","643":"Good to have","644":"Fantastic deal. Buy it.","645":"bought these on sale, they came 2 to the package. nice quality, good light output, appear to be long lasting on the batteries.","646":"When using for any amount of time these get really warm in your hand, great if you want to warm your hands in say-Alaska!","647":"They work great, my some love them. Had a little problem figuring them out, but good now.","648":"These little flashlights are mighty. They feel like they are going to last, metal not plastic. Lots of light!","649":"Wow, can't believe how much light we get out of this little one.","650":"Love the size of these flashlights. Makes them easy to carry with you until you need it. Nice that they come in a pair. Can put one in my purse and one in the car. Very bright for the size it is.","651":"Awesome light if you get this you'll like it I keep one in my room and one in the truck","652":"great Flashlight ,","653":"These are tiny, but mighty. I can keep one in my pocket when needed. The light is very bright and illuminates well.","654":"I ordered these because it's hurricane season here in Hawaii. They came just in time, and they look and feel pretty durable. Perfect to have in the house just in case.","655":"These small flashlights are a lifesaver!","656":"Super happy with how bright they are just wish they had come with batteries","657":"They are small and light, easy to use. The best thing I like is it only need one battery, not three.","658":"Great pocket sized flashlight. These are the best around. Super bright and I love that these can switch in several modes. Flash light can dim to safe on battery life, zoom in for a smaller focus, flash patterns, this is a must for every bug out bag or emergency kit","659":"I love this set of 2 mini but very powerful flashlights I keep 1 in my purse and 1 in the drawer of my nightstand next to my bed for an emergency if the power ever goes out during a storm. You can pull the top part up and down to make the light wider or smaller to fit the amount of light you need. It also has a flashing light on it as well. You can even clip the light to your pants belt clip that is on it. The LED bright light is perfect for helping you find your keys in the dark and also when walking at night time. I will be getting me another set so my kids can have 1 for them to keep in they backpacks.","660":"I like this pack of flashlight so much!! It comes 4 pieces in one package. Also it is very convenient to carry, you can also clip on your pocket!! The light is bright! I will consider buying another set.","661":"Good quality.","662":"Very well made and super bright.","663":"I used these flashlights at night when I take my dog out. They are very bright and work great. They are so small they fit in your pocket! I actually keep one on the leash at night. You can tell it's made of great quality! I can't believe 2 were only $10, it's an amazing value. You need these if you go outside in the dark at all!","664":"Way smaller than I thought. My fault","665":"Love the size, husband and I just got back from a camping trip to the beach. At night we used the flashlights for sand crabs. Also perfect fit in the small pocket of my beach bag. Also has a belt clip, my husband wore his. Bright light and has a blinking setting.","666":"I really like these little flashlights.  They are perfect for keeping in your purse. They also can easily hook onto your waistband. This is what I carry for convenience and safety since they are such a compact size. Gave one to my teenage daughter too. The price is great for two","667":"This set of two flashlights is a great deal. I bought these so I would have one for my purse and an extra around the house. They are super small and compact but brighter than most flashlights. Small and only takes up about as much room as some lip glosses.I love that it only takes one AA to function. These flashlights are great to keep around.","668":"I purchased these flashlights to add to my bug out bag that I carry in my car. They're small, good quality, and only require 1 AA battery. It has a zoom in\/out feature that is very handy. I also like that the power on and off button is at the end of the flashlight for quick access, whereas some other lights I've purchased have them on the side. My husband is using one for when he takes the dogs out to use the restroom at our apt complex and likes it.","669":"good size and bright enough for the price.","670":"cheap item but excellent","671":"These flashlights are awesome. They are small and able to be carried easily. They give a lot of light and we got them just in time to use for a power outage which was perfect!","672":"These flash lights are small but they put off so much light. I bought these for my family and I to take to the beach and use them to go crab hunting. I am very happy with how well these lights have worked.Great quality and compact which makes it easier to take anywhere or carry in purse.","673":"handy little light to have. Like the fact in only takes 1 AA battery.","674":"Very nice! A luxury box to cover these items.","675":"They work and price is unbeatable.","676":"Nice sized little flashlight! They are really bright and compact. Perfect for pocket sized emergencies and for keeping in your purse for extra reassurance.","677":"good","678":"Great miniature lights with big light output.","679":"Great little flashlight. Uses one AA battery. Bright and very compact. Can take it anywhere. It has three modes: very bright, bright and a flashing mode.","680":"Thank you for the Rockbirds LED Flashlights. They are excellent and meet my every need. I have have used them almost daily. The brightess of the light is great and they hold a charge over a longer period of time.","681":"Very good.","682":"Awesome flashlight! Solid construction and the light range is amazing. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.","683":"unbelievable how bright for a little light with rechargeable battery. great price","684":"I picked these up for a song during one of the Amazon deals. They are outstanding little flashlights, plenty bright. I'd recommend the 14500 Li rechargeable batteries at 3.7V if you want the intensity to go up about 3x.","685":"I was hoping the flashlight would be brighter based on the description, but it's not as bright as advertised.","686":"These little flashlights outshine some of the bigger flashlights I've taken with me on camping trips. I also really like the strobe feature, if I ever became lost in the woods, this would come in handy for flagging down assistance. The flashlight also has a clip on it, which makes it very convenient for attaching to my waist or my backpack.","687":"Bright, works great. Warning - keep away from kids. Disconcertingly way too bright for the little ones.","688":"Great flashlight, use it all the time. Also a great deal!","689":"Awesome little flashlights!!! Very bright. Would recommend getting. I am buying a second set.","690":"Bought these little Led flashlights for my grandsons. I don't know why but all my grandkids love flashlights I can't ever have too many.This is the type of flashlight that they can just slip into their pocket without feeling bulky and heavy.Great product for the price. Only downside is that I didn't think they were very bright, but the boys love them.","691":"I needed two mini flashlights to keeps by my kids' bedside ... these work perfectly. They are the right brightness for using when you need to get up out of bed in a dark room -- not blinding, but fully illuminates what you shine it on. Actually brightened the whole room. Not blinding when kids shine it at each other, like they like to do! Great product for the price.","692":"These are great little lights, small, cheap, and bright. What more can I ask for... ? Well, I could ask for a switch that always comes on in bright mode instead of the next mode from when you used it last, very annoying, But overall, a handy little light to drop in your pocket.","693":"So far these seem like good solid lights I would compare them to the \"csi\" nebo lights the only thing I would like better is if you could make then only bright mode and not have to cycle the switch 3 times through dim and strobe to get to bright again","694":"I received this light couple days ago. I was actually amazed how bright it is. Blindingly so. Focuses from beam to spot. I'm using it with a 2000 mAh NiMH AA battery. It seems to be made of pretty resilient materials. The strobe mode was an added plus not mentioned in the specs. I plan to use the light as a backup signal device for night walk. I was so impressed, I just ordered 2 more for my family. Highly recommends!!!!","695":"Awesome shine low price about 12 hours on a battery","696":"I like it and my daughter too. We will use them for camping next week!! \u26fa\ufe0f","697":"Great pair of flashlights that works great and actually have switches that works, unlike many of the cheap flashlights.","698":"Not impressed. These aren't much better than the dollar store flashlights, not very bright, as the high dollar flashlights are.","699":"Great flashlight. Small but powerful.","700":"really cheaply made and flimsy. The light is bright and there's a flimsy lense you can move to adjust the beam... not bad all in all but not great... you get what you pay for.","701":"short and sweet -- one worked, one didn't.\n\nthey're pretty dim, granting powered off a single, AAA battery. That's only 1.5v. their rather small size is appealing for storage in an automobile or a purse, i suppose. those were the purchase designs here, anyway or it's highly unlikely would have gone this route.\n\ncontacted the company twice, indicating one worked\/one didn't. IDK yet if they've responded","702":" I don't manage this account. my wife's account and I'm the occasional buyer. that said, looking at the order history, there's no clear Amazon indication that any adjustments have been made.\n\nlastly, seems one can reasonably expect a hit & miss scenario with these -- notice the irregular pricing, strongly nudging a buyer toward a larger collection. to whit -- we bought a 2-pack for $9.99","703":" now i see both that same 2-pack but also a 4-pack for $12.99.\n\ncaveat emptor","704":"Delivery and packaging was great but the item is poor quality, cheap feeling although it has a metal body. When screwing on the cap to battery compartment the metal sheered on the threads. I do not imagine it will be very long lasting. The light is good, though the pinpoint beam, I expected, would be more spot focused, it is still a fairly wide beam","705":"Very inexpensive and bright. Good to have as backups around the house or for camping","706":"I like","707":"best single AA battery flashlight","708":"These are Great, Small, and Bright flashlights. We use them often and are excellent replacements for the large bulky flashlights we carry in our cars.","709":"Very bright and compact","710":"I got this 2-pack for $8 shipped, so I guess there's little to complain about. I bought them for the cars since the small size doesn't require a space premium. Surprisingly bright for a single AA battery. I'm curious to try them with 14500 batteries to see how they perform. For the price, it can't be beat. They are solid and perform well. Definitely recommendable if on sale.","711":"nice for a small every day use","712":"This is the best little flashlight. It is so bight and such a good size for my purse. I gave the other one to a friend, who was delighted to receive it.\nI love it.","713":"Very nice-was a gift. Fast shipping","714":"Perfect size flashlight for my purse and one for my car. It provides a bright light for such a small flashlight and the price was excellent.","715":"prompt shipping and great item","716":"Great little flashlight for nightstand, car or travel.","717":"Powerful enough and handy tools to run quick inspections of my car.","718":"These are great little flashlights! I bought more of them because I loved them so much! They are extremely bright and easy to carry in your pocket.","719":"Great item thanks","720":"Small but solid and bright. Three click light modes. High, low and strobe. Perfect for camping.","721":"Tiny cheap flashlights that are very bright. I haven't tried freezing them in a block of ice or running over them with a Humvee but there's still time.","722":"Yes, just ok. Runs on a single AA battery. Ok light in a pinch. We're not talking about a zillion lumens, by any stretch. But, click the button, the light goes on. Simple three mode mechanism. Adjustable bezel, push\/pull, to adjust beam size. Flood setting looks best, but not the brighest. Worth the buy, in case of an emergency. Besides, AA batteries are cheaper than dirt, and so easy to find.","723":"The batteries in BOTH flashlights were no good. It took 6 AAA batteries. Not happy.","724":"Awesome for taking the dog for a walk at night.","725":"low price and perfect around the house. I slip one on my belt and take to job sites . Good light and easy to use","726":"I bought these for my son and his friend to take camping on a school trip. They came in really handy because they got caught in the rain while hiking at night and these worked the entire time (almost one hour) until they got back to their campsite. They are small enough to fit in his jacket pocket so he was the only one to have one with him beside the counselor. We have them in a drawer in our kitchen in case the building loses power and it does all summer so they will come in handy. They are very bright and I would not expect that from such a small flashlight.","727":"I wasn't able to open one of them to insert a battery. Very poor design with the battery portal being combined with a light adjustment feature at the top. It just turns and turns as though the battery portal is stripped. What a piece a crap!! It was a waste of time trying to open it and an even bigger waste of money!! In addition, the strobe function should work off an exterior switch that can be activated when the light is on. Not when you turn it off and then turn it back on only to have a useless strobe function activated. That requires you to turn off the light again and turn it back on just to activate its normal function. One agitated customer!","728":"Don't let the edgy design fool you. Very poor light for a flash light. Gives off as much as much light as a 3 dollar harbor freight 2 pack.","729":"I got the 4 pack camping lights the other day.I love them much as they are lightweight and practical.The lights are strong and have zoom in and out.\n3 light modes: strong,SOS,weak.and it has a clip that is sweet.and the price is so reasonable.We need more than 1 flashlight and buying 4 pack is saving some dollars.thanks!","730":"We needed small strong flashlights so we could see our new very dark puppy in the yard in the dark. These are heavy, solid, bright and work perfectly. I would recommend for purse, car, or very dark puppies at night....","731":"One worked. The second one I could not get it open to put the battery in so do not know if it works or not. one good one bad","732":"We often need to head outdoors with no prior warning to deal with issues with the farm animals. A bright, reliable flashlight that can slip into a pocket is a must for us.\n\nShipping was fast with Amazon Prime and the packaging was excellent. These flashlights did not come with batteries, but I had some on hand for the flashlights we already own.\n\nThese flashlights are lightweight and very, very bright. The adjustable beam allows us to search the woods quickly and then to pinpoint what we're searching for. Most recently that was a wild raccoon who was tipping our waste cans and stealing food from the barn cats.\n\nThe clips are strong, enabling us to ensure that the flashlights won't fall out of our pockets while we're working.\n\nI have absolutely no complaints and intend to buy these again!","733":"Great light use it for work. Super bright and you can adjust if you want the beam to be narrow and bright or have it cover more ground but not as bright. I've used one for a couple hours and still have not needed to replace the battery so that's super nice.","734":"These lights are handheld lights and pretty bright. Easy to grip and can conveniently be stored just about anywhere. Good buy!","735":"A great light for little bucks.","736":"Pretty darn good for the price. Clip is stout. No batteries included, but it's a single AAA, and puts out enough light to see well. Had to figure out which end to unscrew as the machining was in good tolerances. That was fun. Glad there were two. For the price, can't beat it.","737":"save your money if you drop them they don't shut off anymore both are broke in less then a week","738":"These things are quality, didn't even know they had three light settings with purchase, pleasant surprise. Gonna buy my brother a couple","739":"I'm amazed that something so cool can be so inexpensive.","740":"Really bright, especially for the size. Took them camping for the weekend, they worked great!","741":"One out of the two works. It did not light up when the battery was a applied. It just over heated.","742":"These flashlights are the most recent addition to my emergency\/camping equipment. They are super bright and only require one battery. You can use them as a spotlight or wide light which is convenient. I love how light weight they are and they have a clip that allows you to keep them on your belt, hat, or backpack and in easy reach. I will be purchasing more!","743":"Really love these little flashlights, they're the best I've found on market. Small, VERY powerful for their size, focusable and only require one AA battery.\n\nWhy not 5 stars? Because of the three modes that you must cycle through every time. I have a couple of flashlights that stay in the same mode unless you repeatedly press the button, and then stay in that mode until changed again. That's the way all of these should work. It's a real pain to have to click so many times, just to get back to the only setting I'll use: high. Make that change and I'll buy a dozen for everyone in the family.","744":"great!","745":"I use this to fend off the demons that haunt me. Works good. So far, I am demon-less.","746":"Perfect size and got flashlight!","747":"Great little lights. The only two downsides are that the clip is tempered and will break if you try to bend it a little more so it's easier to clip on your pocket. The other is that when you turn it off, and then back on it goes to the next mode. So if you turn it off on the bright setting and turn it turn it back on, it'll be on the low setting. The modes are bright, low, & strobe. So I just switch it to strobe before I turn it off, that way it comes on bright. Not a deal breaker for me. But for some it might be.","748":"Great deal for a pair of mini flashlights. Very small and lightweight so very easy to throw in your purse to have just in case or around the house if the power goes out. Fits in the palm of my hand. Takes just one double AA battery. Very bright and you can adjust to turn it even brighter. Pictures I've taken below are in pitch black so you see how bright they are.","749":"Well built , compact, nice light!","750":"Awesome little flashlights! One AA battery and your set. Very bright for the size.","751":"Got the 2-pack for 8$. Absolutely wonderful for that price. Reasonably bright and the focus adjusts really well too.\n\nFor this price, I wouldn't think it twice.","752":"Great Flashlight and packs a lot of power for something so small. Purchased a pair for $8. Went back to get more and price went up to $29!","753":"Go for it . For the price you pay it serves the purpose. Very small and portable","754":"Very well made aluminium tube and very bright. What more could you want? Well, maybe a bigger flashlight. These things are tiny but crank an amazing amount of light given their size. Good for car, purse or pocket. Or to clip on your belt. The ability to focus the beam from narrow to wide is a plus. Be sure to wait for the sales. Prices are all over the map on these things, from as little as $8 (for 2) to almost $30. A good deal at the lower price point.","755":"very bright and portable. will use in the car as a light for maps, task lighting, or, emergencies. great for entering a dark movie theater. would love to try out other products from this supplier.","756":"Decent set of heavy flashlights. I like that they use standard batteries as opposed to rechargeable ones. These lights are bright and get the job done. Good set for the price","757":"Ordered 2 packages - 4 flashlights total. One of the push button toggle switches works only when it feels like it - and it's not often it feels like it. The other 3 flashlights work okay, but I wonder how long before their push button toggle switch craps out.\n\nThis is the first time in 14 years of shopping with Amazon that a product we purchased doesn't work. I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.\n\nIt's not worth the hassle to send a $4 flashlight back. It should be thrown away, but then I'm throwing away $4 of my money. It's not the money, it's the principle. Come on Amazon, just suck it up and mail me a working replacement.","758":"These flashlights are OK. Nothing special.For as cheap as they are, I don't suppose you can set your sights too high!","759":"Very disappointing one of the lights doesn't open, but the one that works is very bright.","760":"it is REALLY bright for 1 AA battary","761":"Best flashlight ever","762":"These units are very bright and powerful. Small but mighty. Fits in a glove box very well.","763":"Nice and bright and well made. I recommend.","764":"It just arrived this morning. After first glance and touch, I think it's well worth the cost... . Small, but rugged and with a great design.","765":"Awesome! Really brute for its size. 1 AA battery is all it needs. Kids love playing with the 'blinking feature.","766":"I am really pleased with this product. They are lightweight and compact. They'll easily fit in my purse or even a pocket. The quality is great too, they're really bright and easy to operate. All in all, I'm very happy with them. They also arrived quickly and were packaged securely. I'd absolutely order again.","767":"Very light weight small penlight , I use this as a backup in search and rescue operations , For the Tuscola County CERT team. The belt clip works well on my Mollie vest . You get a lot better light if you use a 14500 Li-on battery . The Ii-on batteries with the protection circuits are longer . If You use it with the Nitecore protected battery it does fit . However the o ring on the cap doesn't seal because the cap doesn't tighten all the way in. I put a thicker o ring on the cap and it works perfectly. If You use a standard AA battery it works well, just not as bright. It has 3 modes , High, Low, and Strobe . This light is not a blinding power house , But for its size, weight, and price it is Fantastic.","768":"These little flash lights are so useful! I love the fact they are small enough to fit in my handbag, glove box or clip on my pocket. I was not expecting the light to be so bright, they are actually brighter than a bigger much more expensive flashlight my husband keeps in the garage. I will be purchasing a second set to keep in our camper!","769":"With a house full of boys my flash light are always turning up missing. So I find myself looking for smaller but strong and bright flashlights. These led flashlights from rockbirds are the perfect choice for my family. They are small and very sturdy. Strong and very bright. There are what I would call 3 different modes of light. The first is a regular flashlight beam. This light is very bright and shows a long distance from the user. Next is a more.focused beam just pull on the flashlight and you get a smaller more focused beam of light in a square. Next is a flashing mode. I like this one best because I will take the dogs for a walk in the morning before it is light out and I can use this in flashing mode attach it to my jacket so that drivers can see me.\nOverall I have been very impressed with the quality of this flashlight. It is small and light weight. Perfect to keep in your purse, car glove box or anywhere else you might need to.","770":"I love these flashlights. I bought for my son who's going on a camping trip. Very compact. Has three different settings.","771":"Nice little flashlights... they have a distress flash as well as a dim and bright light!","772":"I ordered these because of their size. They fit nicely and discreetly into my purse and I can take it to go in case I need it.These flashlights are nice and bright, perfect for emergency situations or power outages. I don't like having huge bulky flashlights in my tiny apartment. They really take up way too much space. These are well built, strong and will last a long time. Really happy to have found these.","773":"Great little flashlights! When we got them, we put the AA batteries in ( 1 per light) and they worked perfectly! When you click the button the light come on bright, click it again, and it's a different brightness, click it a 3rd time, and it strobes! They even have a little clip on it for a belt or a backpack! When you turn the front edge if it, the \"circle\" of light gets larger and smaller... this will be perfect for camping!!","774":"Absolute junk..Received the 2 lights today : 1 light does not telescope at all..The other turns to strobe whenever you put it down\non a hard surface.","775":"These are super handy and bright! They fit in my pocket but can spot a coyote from a far these are going to be my lifeline out here in the country this year! So glad I purchased these and intend to order another set for my daughter.","776":"Great little flashlight. At first glancethey look so little you wonder how much light they give. These little things give you just as much light as a full size flashlight but with the clip they fit anywhere!","777":"good for the price.","778":"Pretty Good, Not as expected for any pinpoint viewing, also the AA battery depletes very fast. However, When you get 4 of them with the Flash Mode, you got yourself an Instant Seizure!","779":"Rugged, great brightness. WIll get lots of use.","780":"Just like other reviews say, there is 3 settings. High, Low, and Strobe. You can't just use one, so you will have to push the button to go through the three settings. I have one set on high so when I go outside, and I have one set on the strobe that is locked up in the lockbox next to the pistol.","781":"These are so much brighter than I expected! First of all, love that there are two. But the fact that there are different settings makes it a hit with the kids too! Personal flashlight for kid = win. It means that she can handle things on her own despite it being darker in the house than she prefers. On a less personal note, though - Small\/portable, easy to use, super bright. Love it!","782":"These are great handy little flashlights. I put one in my car and after using it my husband said he is taking my other one for his truck. I really love that you can adjust the light to sort of \"zoom in\" on something specific with the light.","783":"I liked these. I didn't realize two came in the package so I was pleasantly surprised. They are extremely bright (which my toddler loves, she uses them to shine on the ceiling during the day). And they only require one AA battery, which is better than some since I don't always have larger batteries on hand.","784":"I didn't expect that the mini flashlights would be as powerful as they are. They're great to keep in your toolbox, glovebox or purse. Also great to keep in a kitchen drawer for power outages, just in case.\nAt just over 3.5\" long they emit a super strong beam of LED light. They are really solid and have a nice weight to them. Two AA batteries (not included) is all it takes to operate them both. I'm going to keep one in the car and use one for camping.\nSince they're water-resistant I can bring it out on the kayak for those evening paddles and I won't have to worry about the flashlight getting splashed.","785":"I got these for my older sons. They are very durable and compact. The light is bright enough. Good buy.","786":"Great item to have. They are so compact that you can carry one in your purse, bag, or car, and not worry about it taking up much room at all. Easy on\/off button for someone with arthritis, or a young child.","787":"Rockbirds LED Flashlight is a very high quality, heavy duty, and super bright tactical flashlight. Extremely satisfied with this product!","788":"These are much brighter than I thought they would be. Its a must if you live in back in the woods. They will be used for alot more than taking the pups out at night. I really like that you can pin point the light as well. Makes for trying to seeing certain things much better. What is great about this is I get one and my husband gets one. Great purchase.","789":"I really like this product. They are the perfect soze.","790":"Don't be fooled by their small appearance they pack a punch! Liked the fact that two came in a package. They are small enough that I kept one in my glove box in my car and one in the bathroom vanity in our upstairs bathroom. When the electricity goes out it always seems like I can never find the flashlights now I have them on every level of my home. With one simple Double A battery they are ready to go. They really give off a lot of light for a small flashlight. I also like the fact that they have a setting that is like a strobe light. That is why I decided to keep one in the car if we ever get stuck in the dark it can be used to flag someone down. I will be purchasing more of these!","791":"I really like this item..Very light,and strong..Built well,and very handy around the house...I wish i could have 2 more...Thanks..Mr.Keiper!","792":"Works really good","793":"I always like to keep a small flashlight in my handbag in case of emergencies- you never know when an elevator will have a power outage or when you'll get stuck outside after dark. These are perfect for that purpose- they're lightweight enough yet comfortable to hold. I like that it comes in a pack of two, so I have a backup. The clip allows me to attach it to the pocket in my handbag for easy retrieval. And for a small flashlight, the LED light is strong, so I can see myself holding this for a long time in case of a power outage, unlike other powerful flashlights that are large, bulky and heavy.","794":"These flashlights work really well. The are heavy duty metal so they feel like they will take some abuse and not break. They get very bright which is obviously what you want from a flashlight. You get 2 so its a good value for your money. I keep one in the car for emergencies and my husband has the other one. I think these will last a very long time.","795":"Awesome Light I love it Thank you Thank you","796":"Have only used a few times but are so far they are good, especially for the price paid.","797":"pretty bright for a little flashlight.","798":"ran over it with a forklift still works fine nothing broke off of it","799":"I ordered my Rockbird led Flashlight thinking i was getting one. I am so surprised at the fact I recieved two. These by the way came so fast by prime. They didnt come with batteries so i loaded them today. Woot hoo. they are bright exactly what I aspected with LED. Nice and small fit so comfortly in my hand as a women the are about the size of my palm. I am totally keeping one of these in my kitchen and one in my SUV. Totally never know when its needed. Has a screw off top to change batteries as well as a nice sturdy clip to hold onto stuff. These Rock! Thank you again for the great Deal.","800":"This flashlight has exceeded my expectations so far, I've had it about a month I bought them because I have a lot of AA batteries and they were cheap. I had a similar Cree with rechargeable batteries it lasted three months barely on my last deployment, this one is a month in and going strong,it's been doused in jet fuel and dropped more times then I know but still shines bright for 10 bucks and you get two can't beat it.","801":"Don't be fooled by the size of these flashlights. They might be mini, but they give off so much light. These two flashlights are so convenient and handy. The fact that they are small, they can fit anywhere (glove department, purse, pocket- there's even a clip that you can attach to your pocket). Will be a great addition to a survival kit.","802":"Definitely a fan of these flashlights, they are small but very bright. Really good quality and the clip on them is perfect for outdoor activities when not in use. The perfect size to keep in a convenient place, I put one in my glove compartment and another in my first aid kit. Definitely recommend these as you get an excellent product for the price.","803":"My husband works in the oilfield so I grabbed this two pack for him and his friend to use while at work. They are simple, only take 1 battery, and they really liked the brightness of the light and the fact that it has a tight clip on it so it stays in their pocket well.","804":"Always, always need flashlights in our house and only LED ones. The flashlight is bright, has a belt clip, fits perfectly in your hand and compact. It has a caution mode, where the light blinks to let others know something is wrong. HOpefully no one will ever have to use that setting. This flashlight being so compact is great for you need to look under cabinets and small spaces. My husband used it for the lower compartment on his boat.","805":"Really cool little flashlights. These are fairly small and light but they are also very sturdy. They do not feel cheap or weak in any way. Really nice quality, well made. I like that they are small, makes them super portable. I also like the adjustable focus feature, could come in handy. I definitely like these and can surely recommend this product.","806":"They work as advertised. It's a handy little light.","807":"They work good but are small. Only about 3 inches each but still strong light.","808":"Powerful!","809":"Great quality for the price!","810":"Surprisingly bright for size.","811":"I am very happy I purchased the Rockbirds LED Flashlights. They are the perfect size for your purse, pocket, fanny pack or to store in the door of your car. They are easy to use and very bright. They come in a pack of two. I put one in my Jeep and the other in my husbands truck. I have used mine every time I have come home at night and needed to light my way to the door. I highly recommend these flashlights.","812":"Great little flashlights that put out Great light. I recently started with a volunteer Fire Department and was looking for tools to fill my pockets with. Flashlights are one of those key tools. This little flashlight is simple to use and even with it being so small and with wearing gloves, it is easy to turn on and off. Definitely worth the buy.","813":"These are small enough to carry in a purse or backpack. I personally carry one in my purse for those times when I am going to my car late in the evening and need a light to see. I take evening classes and sometimes going to my car is a little scary, so I really like having the flashlight readily available. It eases my stress and fears waking to my car being able to actually see. We recently lost power and I used my rockbird flashlight most of the evening. I was amazed at how long and well it worked. I am very happy with these flashlights and look forward to using them for camping and hiking over the summer. I am impressed for as small as they are, they emit quite a bit of light.","814":"Great little flashlight for the price, super bright and sturdy.","815":"these are the bigest bang for youe buck. very very bright. i was looking for something to keep in my vehicle that wasnt big but was still bright wnought ro get the job down and this is the PERFECT flash light for that!\n\nI have no relation to the seller, this is my honest opinion. :)","816":"Very bright flashlight. I like the LED glow vs the regular lens. Item come packed well in a box. Very good quality. Metal casing that can stand up to wear and tear. I plan on using these lights for emergency and also when we go camping. It is nice that there is a place to put a clip or lanyard.","817":"They cheap, so they don't get held to super high standards. The slide to amplify light is only useful when at max power. The light gets focused into some logo I can't make out. Not good or bad, just an observation.","818":"Super bright little flashlights. The focus on them is fun, but usually not very necessary. They seem like they can handle a pretty good beating. I carry one on my belt at work as it is compact, lightweight, and it comes in really handy. The only complaint I have is I wish the belt clip was heavier","819":" I snagged it on my bench the other day while I was working and bent it all up. I took off the clip (held on by two small allen screws) and applied some love with a pair of pliers and it works great again. I don't know if anyone else would have this problem and it's easy to fix, so it's not worth taking off a star. I may make a heavier clip for it myself though.\n\nOverall, they do what I expect them to do.","820":"This set of two flashlights are a great deal in my opinion. I gave my husband one to use in his tow truck and one stays in the house for me. These flashlights are very bright and you can adjust the scope of the light from a large area to a precise close area. I use my flashlight in the house to check on eggs in an incubator so I pull the top of the flashlight out to narrow the scope. It is plenty bright for me to see the babies in the eggs. My husband has used his for lots of things in the tow truck. It is great for lots of jobs since it has adjustable lighting. It's also easy for him to keep on himself with the metal clip and non-slip grip. I like that they are made with aluminium so they are lightweight and durable. So far they show no wear and tear even though we are constantly using them.","821":"Tell you the truth... i bought them for my mother in law who was always complaining about not having flashlight when ahe loses power in the house and ahe bothered me to borrow mine. Now since I got her these flashlights she doesnt even use them and keep bugging me for flashlights... guess what i took flashlights back for myself and borrow her the ones i bought her... great , small and so bright... ask my mother in law!!","822":"Very bright and no problems so far.","823":"These were purchased as gifts. Both recipients are very happy with the lights. These are being used as Every Day Carry (EDC) tools. These have been in daily carry\/use for three months with no complaints. Very bright, work great, good battery life and a variable beam at a great price....what is not to like?\n\nRemember...it is not a Streamlight, SureFire, Fenix, etc....but it works, and it's 5$. Worth every penny!","824":"These are great little flashlights. Very compact and very bright. Small enough to fit in my pocket","825":" and they are very sturdily built. Recommended.","826":"Great price, bright for a little flashlight.","827":"This flash light is very nice. It has an option of a dimmed light, flashing light, and also a bright and long extended light. I like it a lot and have used it lot.","828":"The flashlights are light weight and very bright. Once you put the battery on it's a bit difficult to put the bottom back on. But it's a clear white light and not that yellow hue. So it's a great find especially since you get two! I use them when I'm walking around at night and it doesn't take up space at all.","829":" These are good quality tactical flashlights. They have three modes and in the video I am posting along with this review you can see the difference in the 3 modes which are changeable with a click of the button at the end of the flashlight. There is a sturdy pocket clip mounted to the side of the flashlights with two small screws. So far I haven't had any problems with the flashlights which seem to be pretty durable and are just what I expected.","830":"No problems at all ,strong lil lights","831":"I use this flashlight for work. It has awesome brightness and uses one AA battery as opposed to the expensive special batteries the tactical flashlights usually take. Works great for up close or zoom it in for distance. Definitely a good buy, especially for the price.","832":"I purchased the LED Flashlight by Rockbirds because I wanted a flashlight I could easily put into the center console of my Jeep. This flashlight is perfect because it is small enough to fit just about anywhere that you want to put a flashlight. You could carry this in your purse, your vehicle, it even has a clip for a belt. Just remember, batteries are not included. So you will need two AA batteries. I am pleased with this purchase. :-)","833":"I had bought a pair similar to these previously and really like the design. This brand however was cheapened considerably. I was not impressed with the switch most of all. Being not as crisp as the other brand.","834":"This is probably the best and most compact set of flashlights I've ever owned! I don't like candles so they are perfect for power outages and I'm always losing things so the ultra brightness is very effective for that too!","835":" These Rockbirds LED Flashlights I bought came it a pack of 2 for only $9.99 which is a crazy good deal. I collect LED flashlights and have about 30 right now but I really like these smaller ones because I can just keep them in my pocket.\nThese are heavy duty and made with aluminum. The battery compartment has an O ring to keep moisture out. They are waterproof but not to be submerged in water but they will withstand rain.\nThe beam is adjustable and you can see that in the video I provided to go with this review and I also show all 3 modes of lighting. All you need to do is slightly tap the on and off switch and it will change modes.\nPlease watch the video to get a better idea of what I am talking about. Overall it is excellent for the price and you get 2! I give this 5 stars easily. I hoped this helped in some way.","836":"great little lights","837":"love them","838":"Excellent! These are great!","839":"MUY BUEN PRODUCTO","840":"Rock solid construction with great beams of light. Only use 1 AA size battery. It fits comfortably in my jeans pocket and compliments my EDC. Not to mention that the price is extremely reasonable.\n\nWhat's not to like? :))","841":"Dropped the light one time. Now the slightest change in grip will turn it to strobe or off. But it's bright.","842":"Really like these flashlights! Work very well. Very useful.","843":"bright and compact design. have them all thru out my house.","844":"These are great flashlights. They are perfect for any outdoor activity - hunting, fishing, walking your dog and picking up poop... They are heavy duty so they can be packed in your gear and will stand up to the rugged outdoors.","845":"Wow these were a lot brighter than I expected. I bought one to attach to my home defense shotgun and the other for my car. The only draw back was not being able to get the belt clip off without snapping it but no biggie.","846":"Great for the price.No complaints so far.","847":"When turning these on, you get a different mode each time. Who wants a flashlight that shines a random mode each time? I use the same mode 99% of the time so have to change modes every time I turn it on. No thanks.","848":"After getting screwed by the seller Vaya I bought this 2 pack. Not bad for a $4 flashlight. The clips are strong, might have to modify the clip. I'm happy with this product. Get what you pay for. I waited nearly 2 months for the Vaya and never did get it. This one I got overnight.","849":"These are GREAT!","850":"The lights are Nice. Several others are similar.however promised the Xmas Delivery.. no-show- Still waiting for some type of acknowledgement.\n\nps it kept saying out for delivery. im rural and i froze three days waiting for the driver"}}
